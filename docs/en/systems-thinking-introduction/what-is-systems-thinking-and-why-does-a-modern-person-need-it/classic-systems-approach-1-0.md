# Classic Systems Approach 1.0

At the core of the systems approach lies the concept of a "system." Using this, the constructor thinks about a world of objects or things [ ^1 ]. Here, an analogy can be drawn with physics, where the concept of a "physical body" is introduced. This refers to a material object that has mass, shape, and volume. In physics, all discussions and laws are tied to the physical body, and when physical laws are applied in practice, "physical body" is replaced by the corresponding material object: a road, a chair, a rocket, or a piston.

The same occurs with the concept of a "system." Every professional works with their own systems. For some, the system might be a house, a computer program, or a trained artificial intelligence; for others—a child ready for adulthood, or a grown tree or grove. Every person consciously or unconsciously creates systems. A system constructor does this consciously, relying on various systems methodologies.

In specific projects, "systems" are highlighted from the physical world by the attention of an individual or a team. Systems thinking is the ability to identify, describe, and create systems [ ^2 ] and to perform certain actions with them. The systems approach offers methodologies based on the concept of a "system" to develop systems thinking. There are several generations of the systems approach, each containing different methodologies [ ^3 ]. All methodologies of each generation are unified by the concept of a "system."

In the first version of the systems approach [ ^4 ], developed by L. von Bertalanffy, systems are viewed as objects representing a certain class. One can consider the "clock" system. Note that this is an ideal concept (although we imagine the clock as physical), not a specific physical object that one can point to. We are not talking about a wristwatch or a clock on a space station. An objective examination of systems implied that systems are objects discussed independently from subjects. Therefore, in systems approach 1.0, one can discuss simply a clock, a table, or a vehicle and identify different properties in these systems—integrity, emergence, and nestedness. The classic approach predominantly examines these three properties of any system.

A person cannot simultaneously consider the entire world as a whole; their brain lacks the computational capacity. Through attention, a person highlights what is important from reality while trying not to lose the connection of this important aspect to the world as a whole—maintaining context. The concept of a "system" allows for managing attention, and thus it is sometimes said that systems thinking is the ability to manage attention.

The property of "integrity" implies that a system has a boundary, and the connections between its parts are much stronger than with other objects in physical reality. This property helps highlight systems through attention. In simple objects like a table or a vehicle, boundaries are straightforward, but when examining complex systems (such as an airport or a university), defining boundaries becomes challenging. It is difficult to grasp what the water safety system, the pass issuance system, or the heating system entails. We'll discuss complex systems in more detail later.

The second important property of a system is emergence. In English, "emerge" means appearance. Emergence refers to a system acquiring a new property (function) that none of its individual parts possessed. For example, the engine, chassis, and cabin together form the system of a vehicle, which possesses the function of transporting a passenger. None of the vehicle's parts has this function on its own. It arises when all subsystems are assembled together. Any system possesses the property of emergence, and if it lacks such a function, it is not a system.

The third property of classic systems is nestedness [ ^5 ]. Nestedness can be visualized as a matryoshka: one system fits into another, which serves as a supersystem for it. The property of nestedness means that any system itself is a supersystem for some subsystems, and also itself belongs to a larger supersystem. If we assert that we have a system, it automatically has subsystems and a supersystem.

All three properties described above of the classic systems approach help to highlight necessary objects from the physical world, maintain focus on the system itself, and if necessary, examine its structure (subsystems) while not losing connection to the physical world (supersystem).

Consider the example of the "clock" system. Firstly, this system can always be represented in the physical world. Clocks have the property of integrity; they have a boundary. Clocks have an emergent property, meaning they have a function—showing time. This function only appears when all the clock parts are assembled together. None of the clock parts has this property on its own. Nestedness is evident in the fact that each element of the clock is part of the whole system. Moreover, the clock face itself also has subsystems. Each subsystem will have its own properties of integrity, emergence, and nestedness.

Thus, the classic systems approach establishes a certain thinking or worldview through system properties, and this cognitive technique will be used in the following generations of systems approach 2.0 and 3.0.

[ ^1 ]: Do not confuse the physical world with mental space. A person is a physical world object, while the concept of "age" is an abstract object.  
[ ^2 ]: Involving professionals in applied methods.  
[ ^3 ]: Although all systems methodologies are based on the concept of a "system," they may employ their own unique set of concepts. Aside from differences in concept sets, methodologies also vary by systems approach generations.  
[ ^4 ]: Several methodologies were pioneered by Alexander Bogdanov, Edward de Bono, Peter Drucker, Alfred Chandler, and others.  
[ ^5 ]: We will discuss the nestedness of physical systems within each other. The relationship of nestedness between two physical objects as "part-whole" differs from the relationships of "class-member of class" and "superclass-subclass."
