title: What Does "Apply Systems Thinking" Mean?
---

Applying systems thinking means skillfully operating with the concepts of transdisciplines from the intellect stack in your activities. Mastering the conceptual minimum entails not just knowing each concept but also being able to connect them and apply them to your projects. In this course, you study systems thinking concepts, linking them not only to each other but also to entrepreneurship, engineering, and management concepts.

When someone says they will apply a systems approach, it means they will use the conceptual minimum of systems thinking in their activities. Without mastering these concepts, a person might be logical, systematic, professional, and many other things, but definitely not systems-oriented.

A professional with an extensive track record doesn't necessarily possess systems thinking. Even though they can tackle any complexity within their subject area, we consider someone a system constructor if they have deliberately^[This means focusing attention on the conceptual minimum and identifying these concepts in work projects.] studied and applied modern systems methodology concepts in both work and personal projects^[There is no 100% guarantee of success in all these projects. However, all else being equal, the probability of success increases with systems thinking.].

A system constructor should also set their "type classifier"â€”the ability to track the types of applied concepts. For instance, an average adult would notice a mismatch in types in the following list: "I visited New York, London, and China." Here, the type "city" is used alongside the type "country," which from a systems thinking perspective is incorrect and suggests avoiding mixing types. Similarly, a system constructor detects mismatches in statements like: "Attendees at the meeting included John, Andrew, and the contractor's accountant," or "I perform roles as a marketer, financier, and department head." In other words, the type "performer" is mixed with the type "role," and in the second example, the type "role" is mixed with the type "position," which is incorrect, and it is advisable not to mix types in work activities^[If you don't understand these examples, take the "Rational Work" course.].

The type classifier^[A kind of thinking mastery ingrained in mind and body. An error signal in types is sensed at the bodily level, which is why people speak of ontological jitter. Besides jitter, it is recommended in intellectual activities to pay attention to other bodily sensations such as thinking resonance and creative click.

Thus, types of system concepts like system, role, position, process, etc., should not be mixed. Training the type classifier occurs in the "Rational Work" course, although some students had it set up in university and quickly adapt it to the new conceptual base.
