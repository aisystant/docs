# What Does It Mean to "Apply Systems Thinking"?

Applying systems thinking means you skillfully leverage concepts from various transdisciplines within the intellect stack in your activities. Mastery of the conceptual minimum implies not just knowing each concept, but also being able to connect them with each other and applying them to your projects. In the course, you study systems thinking concepts, linking them not only with each other but also with concepts from entrepreneurship, engineering, and management.

If someone says they will apply a systems approach, it means they will use the conceptual minimum of systems thinking in their work. If a person does not possess these concepts, they may be logical, systematic, professional, and many things, but not systems-oriented.

A professional with a substantial track record does not necessarily possess systems thinking. They might solve any problem within their field of expertise but we would consider a system constructor to be someone who has consciously [^1] studied and applies the concepts of modern systems methodology in their work and personal projects [^2].

Moreover, a system constructor should have a "type classifier/cognitive type machine" â€” the ability to track the types of concepts being applied. For example, an ordinary adult can spot the inconsistency in the list: "I visited New York, London, and China." Here, the type "city" is used along with the type "country," which is incorrect from a systems thinking perspective, and it is better not to mix types. Similarly, a system constructor tracks inconsistencies in sentences like: "John Doe, Andrew Smith, and the contractor's accountant attended the meeting," or "I perform roles of a marketer, financier, and department head." In the first example, the type "executor/performer (agent)" is used alongside the type "role," and in the second, the type "role" alongside the type "position," which is incorrect, and it's better not to mix types in work activities [^3].

The type classifier/cognitive type machine [^4] allows for the fluent application of systems thinking, avoiding confusion in descriptions (modeling) and communication within complex projects. It's vital not to confuse types of system concepts such as system, role, position, process, etc. The setup for the type classifier/cognitive type machine occurs in the "Rational Work" course, although some students had it established back in college and quickly adapt it to a new conceptual base.

[^1]: Attention is focused on the conceptual minimum, as well as identifying these concepts in work projects.
[^2]: There's no 100% guarantee that all projects will be successful. However, all else being equal, the likelihood of success increases with systems thinking.
[^3]: If these examples are unclear to you, join the "Rational Work" course.
[^4]: As an ontological skill embedded in the brain and body. An error signal in types is noticed on a sensory level in the body, hence the term ontological jitter. Besides jitter, it is recommended to pay attention to other bodily sensations in intellectual activities, such as cognitive resonance and creative click.
