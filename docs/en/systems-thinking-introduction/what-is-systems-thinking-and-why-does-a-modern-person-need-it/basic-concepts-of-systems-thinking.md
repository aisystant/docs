title: Basic Concepts of Systems Thinking
---

Often, people who change their country of residence and immerse themselves in another language are asked, "What language do you think in now?" To think in a particular language means to use it as a tool for organizing thoughts, planning, reasoning, and engaging in internal dialogue. Language and thought are closely linked, but this does not mean that thinking entirely depends on language.

Language serves as an instrument that can shape and structure cognitive processes—a concept known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. This theory suggests that the language we speak affects our perception of the world and our way of thinking.

Typically, when discussing "language," most immediately think of foreign languages, and few consider professional languages, such as those used by physicists or mathematicians, swimmers or drivers, engineers or managers. Thus, a person learns not just Russian or English throughout their life, but also professional languages. In essence, learning professional languages is not much different from mastering everyday conversational language.

Besides professional languages, there is a meta-language or systems language. This systems language uses specific words to denote certain concepts, which may differ across foreign languages. For example, the core concept of systems thinking can be expressed as “система” (in Russian) or “system.” In addition to the concept of system, there are other systems thinking concepts such as system of interest, supersystem, function, architecture, role, method (practice), and so on.

Therefore, one of the shortest answers to the question "What does systems thinking mean?" is "It's when you think in a systems language." Moreover, systems thinking helps create successful products and services that take numerous interests into account.

Learning systems thinking is as necessary as learning any foreign language. That means studying the concepts (words) and applying them in your projects and life. It's essential to immerse yourself in an environment of like-minded individuals. For example, Aisystant develops as such a community, which is why we recommend writing your drafts in the Aisystant club. Of course, it's important to take this learning seriously and appreciate the importance of mastering a systems language, as achieving fluency will take years.

However, just as with a foreign language, new opportunities arise. These opportunities are even more significant because the systems language opens doors to all professional languages and the creation of successful systems in work and personal life. You'll be able to master these professions more quickly in any foreign language.

Therefore, study the systems methodology and think in the systems language, rather than just in everyday Russian or English!

One of the essential skills for a modern individual is the ability to learn quickly. Humans do this much faster than any other creature on earth. Some people learn faster than others, making fewer mistakes and living better. To learn quickly, it's crucial to understand that education is primarily about studying theories and connecting them with practical activities. The best theories help humanity advance civilization.

Any theory consists of specific concepts that describe the world, and these should be the focus when studying theories. It's important to write them down and interlink them during course study, as well as identify their manifestations in the physical world.

In physics, concepts such as physical body, speed, and force are introduced to describe natural phenomena, the structure, and evolution of the material world. In accounting, concepts like asset, liability, and double entry are introduced to describe an enterprise’s activities (such as a balance sheet) for tax accounting. In a systems thinking course, concepts are gathered that are necessary for creating a successful system and organizing a large team of specialists from various professions.

Can systems be created without the concepts of systems thinking? Of course, they can. But it would be akin to ignoring the laws of physics or learning to swim by jumping straight into the pool without understanding the theory of the crawl. You'll get by somehow. We're offering an intellectual language for explaining and changing the world, competing with other schools of thought.

With systems thinking concepts, you can not only work more quickly, increasing the complexity of the systems you create, but also apply these concepts to create entirely different systems: IT systems, airplanes, houses, nuclear power plants, or preparing a child for adult life.

Try to evaluate your understanding of systems thinking concepts on your own. Speak aloud or better yet, write down your interpretations of each item related to systems thinking concepts. Here are the majority of concepts studied in Aisystant courses, organized so that you can not only discuss each concept but also explain how it differs from other, similar concepts.

1. The use of a systems approach or systems thinking and systematicity
2. Synergy and emergence
3. Physical world and mental space
4. Nestedness and hierarchy
5. Description, embodiment, and system documentation
6. Alpha and work artifact
7. Work and methods (practices)
8. Functional analysis and modular synthesis
9. Processes, projects, and tasks
10. Physical object (executor), functional object (role), and function (behavior)
11. Word, object, and system
12. Function and design
13. Intention, subject of interest, and preference
14. Role, subject of interest, role interest (preference), and method of description
15. Discipline and tools
16. Function and service
17. Improvement and development
18. Strategy and strategizing
19. Managing work and managing methods (practices)
20. Black and transparent boxes
21. Architecture and non-architecture
22. Systems of systems and people in systems
23. Systems-oriented and traditional leadership
24. Stages and phases of a project
25. Transdiscipline and discipline, method and theory
26. Role, executor, title, and position
27. Role, method (practice), and work artifact
28. Discontent and subject of interest
29. Entrepreneur, engineer, and manager
30. System levels, creation chains, fields of interest
31. Managing work: project management, process management, and case management
32. Org-roles and organizational units
33. System architecture and enterprise architecture
34. Models, metamodels, multi-models, mega-models
35. Modeling and meta-modeling
36. Meta-system transition and emergence
37. System of interest, supersystem, creation system, system in surroundings, our system, subsystem
38. Successful system and ethics
39. Subject of interest (concern), method of description (viewpoint), description (view).

This exercise is beneficial both during and after completing each Aisystant course. By learning each concept, you'll be able not only to speak the same language as entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers but also to rapidly acquire new professional knowledge, becoming a sought-after specialist.
