# Core Concepts of Systems Thinking

People who move to a different country and immerse themselves in a new language are often asked, "What language do you think in now?" Thinking in a particular language means using that language to organize thoughts, plan, reason, and conduct an internal dialogue [ ^1 ].

Language is a tool that can shape and structure thought processes. This concept is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [ ^2 ]. It suggests that the language we speak influences our worldview and way of thinking.

Typically, when we talk about "language," most people immediately think of foreign languages, and few consider professional languages, such as those of a physicist, mathematician, swimmer, or driver, engineer, or manager. Thus, over a lifetime, a person learns not just Russian or English but also professional languages. Essentially, learning professional languages is not much different from learning conversational languages.

In addition to professional languages, there is also a meta-language or systems language. Systems language uses its own words to designate certain concepts, which might be named differently in various foreign languages. For example, a core systems concept can be expressed with the word "система (in Russian)" or 'system.' Beyond the concept of system, there are other systems concepts like system of interest, supersystem, function, architecture, role, method (practice), etc.

Therefore, one of the shortest answers to the question “What does systems thinking mean?” is “It’s when you think in the systems language.” From there, one can discuss how systems thinking helps create successful products and services that take into account numerous interests.

Learning systems thinking is necessary, similar to learning any foreign language. This means one must study concepts (words) and apply them in projects and life. Immersing yourself in an environment is crucial, which is why being part of a community of like-minded individuals is essential [ ^3 ]. Of course, it is important to seriously embrace this learning and acknowledge the importance of mastering the systems language. Becoming fluent in it will take years.

Yet, as with a foreign language, new opportunities emerge. These opportunities are more significant because systems language opens doors to any professional language and to creating successful systems in work and personal life. Plus, you will be able to master these professions more quickly in any foreign language.

Therefore, study the systems methodology and think in the systems language, not just in conversational Russian or English!

One of the primary skills of a modern person is the ability to learn quickly. Humans do this much faster than any other animal on Earth. However, some people learn faster than others and, as a result, make fewer mistakes and live better. To learn quickly, it is essential to understand that learning is, first of all, about studying theories. And naturally, these theories need to be linked with practical activities. The best theories help humanity advance civilization.

In turn, any theory consists of certain concepts used to describe the world. It is important to focus on these when studying theories. Write them down explicitly and connect them with each other during the courses, as well as find their manifestations in the physical world.

Physics introduces concepts such as physical body, velocity, force, and so on. These concepts are necessary to describe natural phenomena, the structure, and evolution of the material world. In the discipline of accounting, concepts such as asset, liability, double-entry bookkeeping, and others are introduced to describe the activities of an enterprise (accounting balance) for tax purposes. The systems thinking course gathers concepts required for creating successful systems and organizing large teams of specialists from various fields.

Can systems be created without systems concepts? Of course, they can. But it’s like ignoring the laws of physics or trying to learn to swim through practice without understanding the theory of stroke. You will achieve something anyway. We offer an intellectual language for explaining and changing the world, and in this, we compete with other schools of thought.

With systems concepts, not only can you work faster by increasing the complexity of created systems, but you can also apply these concepts to the creation of entirely different systems: an IT system, an airplane, a house, a nuclear power plant, or a child ready for adult life.

Try to independently assess your mastery level of systems concepts. Talk to yourself, or better yet, write down drafts for each point about the systems concepts. Here lies the majority of concepts studied in the AISYSTANT courses. They are grouped not just to talk about each concept but to explain its distinction from other similar concepts.

1. The use of a systems approach or systems thinking and systematicity
2. Synergy and emergence
3. The physical world and mental space
4. Nestedness and hierarchy
5. Description, embodiment, and system documentation
6. Alpha and work artifact
7. Works and methods (practices)
8. Functional analysis and modular synthesis
9. Processes, projects, and tasks
10. Physical object (executor), functional object (role), and function (behavior)
11. Word, object, and system
12. Function and structure
13. Intention, subject of interest, and preference
14. Role, subject of interest, role interest (preference), and method of description
15. Discipline and tools
16. Function and service
17. Improvement and development
18. Strategy and strategizing
19. Managing works and managing methods (practices)
20. Black and transparent boxes
21. Architecture and non-architecture
22. Systems of systems and people in systems
23. Systems-oriented and traditional leadership
24. Stages and phases of the project
25. Transdiscipline and discipline, method and theory
26. Role, executor, title, and position
27. Role, method (practice), and work artifact
28. Dissatisfaction and subject of interest
29. Entrepreneur, engineer, and manager
30. System levels, creation chains, areas of interest
31. Managing works: project management, process management, and case management
32. Organizational roles and organizational units
33. System architecture and enterprise architecture
34. Models, metamodels, multimodels, megamodels
35. Modeling and meta-modeling
36. Meta-system transition and emergence
37. System of interest, supersystem, creation system, surrounding systems, our system, subsystem
38. Successful system and ethics
39. Subject of interest (concern), method of description (viewpoint), description (view)

This exercise is valuable to perform during and after each AISYSTANT course. By learning each concept, you will not only find a common language with entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers, but you will also learn new professional knowledge more quickly, becoming a sought-after specialist.
