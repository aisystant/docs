# What is Systems Thinking?

There is no single precise definition of "systems thinking," just as it is impossible to give a complete definition of "mother." We might say that systems thinking is a thought process that involves using the concept of a system and other concepts from the intellect stack. Or that to think in a systems way is to think in the systems language. Alternatively, systems thinking might be described as a way to create successful products and services by considering numerous interests.

There's nothing supernatural, mystical, or esoteric about systems thinking. We won't delve into the structure of thought at a neuro-level or discuss various psychological aspects. We believe any form of thinking develops through the study of specific theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real life. These are the concepts you'll study and apply in your professional and personal projects.

Why is systems thinking necessary?

Our world is complex and rapidly changing. But what exactly makes it complex, and what is changing so quickly?

The complexity lies in the multitude of interests held by different people. Not only are these interests changing rapidly, but so are knowledge and work methods, workplaces, teams, and fields of activity. To create successful products and services, one must be able to work with contemporary speeds and complexities. Systems thinking addresses this problem.

For instance, in creating a car, you must consider the interests of the driver, passenger, pedestrian (to minimize harm in collisions), car owner (ensuring it doesn't frequently break down and retains value), automotive corporation (for sales success), aesthete (for aesthetic appeal), environmentalist (to prevent pollution), and the interests of several hundred other roles. Each interest is backed by a certain worldview (model, description). Similar interests can be identified in your own systems—for instance, a renovated apartment, a raised and ready-for-life child, a planted tree, an IT application, an enterprise, and so on.

Moreover, due to the need for rapid adaptation to new conditions and the swift acquisition of new skills, everyone today constantly learns new practices or professions and familiarizes themselves with new fields of activity, ideally without stress or delay.

Mastery of systems thinking helps you understand a new area of activity in just two weeks. A person without systems thinking might spend years studying the same field. Why is this the case? It's because a person with systems thinking will pay attention to the system of interest and other systems (supersystem, creation system, etc.), roles, methods, work artifacts, functional and modular parts, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and other objects of focus in any field of activity. These concepts can be found in IT, culinary arts, and infrastructure projects alike.

Humanity is progressing towards a division of labor. Centuries ago, there was perhaps only one role—"medicus," responsible for all human ailments. Now in medicine, we might distinguish hundreds (if not thousands) of roles. Such division occurs in all spheres of human activity. No individual can deeply master every role. But to understand which specialists you need (and what roles they should play in your projects), systems thinking is essential. It allows you to "slice" the world into separate yet interconnected systems and subsystems.

Implemented systems thinking not only helps integrate quickly into new environments or projects but also aids in attention management, eliminating the irrelevant at any given moment while maintaining a holistic view. Our brains may lack the computational power to process all a project's details, so concentrating all resources on the right "place" is crucial, as is timely shifting focus. Understanding the layout and connection of all these "places" is also vital. Knowing the principles of systems thinking can reduce meeting times from an hour to just 10 minutes by managing attention effectively and highlighting focal points for the entire team.

It should be noted that while systems thinking enables quick navigation through issues in various work areas, it does not replace applied mastery. However, with systems thinking, you will progress faster in your applied fields and become a professional more quickly.

Systems thinking allows us to break complex projects into more manageable parts, link theory with practice, work in large collectives, and organize our teams. It also helps us keep all important project aspects in mind, using special modeling tools to ensure nothing is overlooked in the hustle.

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, applicable to objects of various complexities: whether inert substances, living organisms, cyber-physical systems, individuals, organizations, communities, or even humanity as a whole.

We believe systems thinking is necessary for any modern person aiming for a career and to become a Chief Transformation Officer of a large business. Yet, systems thinking is universal, suitable for personal development, as well as that of a child, community, and society.

What do the words "systems thinking" mean?

In the previous subsection, we already discussed that most people operate with a colloquial understanding of systems thinking and confuse the concepts of using a systems approach and systematicity.

Additionally, some refer to "systems thinking" as an exceptional human capacity, like the ability to combine analysis (understood as a deep dive into details) and synthesis (understood as the timely emergence from these details). It's akin to seeing the big picture—valued as much as wealth and health over poverty and sickness.

Unfortunately, such explanations are not about "systems" or a systems approach. Descriptions about diving into and emerging from details don't explain how to master this technique or apply it in everyday tasks for entrepreneurs, engineers, managers, or other specialists.

Systems thinking implies a form of human thought that operates with a specific systems language. It uses the concept of "system" and other notions dictated by certain transdisciplines in the intellect stack. These include concept formulation, ontology, physics, mathematics, and others. You could also say it's the application of thinking techniques from a systems approach.

There are numerous variations of systems approaches, which you'll learn about in the "Systems Thinking" course. Essentially, the approach involves applying terms, methods of thinking, and action techniques developed in one discipline (subject area) to others. Our take on the systems approach involves applying the concepts, techniques, and methods from transdisciplines in the intellect stack to professional and personal fields, as well as the disciplines needed for numerous project implementations. We are discussing the third generation of systems approaches.

The systems approach pertains to methodologies, where the central theme is transmitting knowledge. Systems thinking, on the other hand, is a human ability (and here the emphasis is on "thinking").

Human thought is an intellectual activity resulting in the formation of a description of reality, assisting in taking necessary actions—including the creation of products (systems) and services. To form such descriptions, we use words (terms, concepts). If you haven't specifically learned systems thinking, you're likely using everyday words instead of concepts from the modern intellect stack.

The difference between a layperson and a systems professional is that the latter operates with system concepts such as system, role, method (practice), work artifact, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergent properties, and others, which are studied in our course.

Systems thinking must be specifically learned, just like mathematics, physics, marketing, or management. The first step in this learning—like in any learning—is focusing on the conceptual minimum and applying it in practice. Pure practice, without the study of transdisciplines, will either not lead to systems thinking, or it may take decades.

Our course also trains thinking techniques—the ability to link different concepts together and identify physical objects in real projects connected with these concepts. For example, find the system of interest and its creator, delineate the link "role-method (practice)-work artifact," and divide the system into functional and modular parts. That's why we recommend studying this course with mandatory modeling. When applying systems thinking concepts and techniques to a project, teams save time and resources in creating a successful system and can reach consensus more effectively.

During the process, you will need to learn to think simultaneously about the three interrelated systems: the "system of interest," the "supersystem," and the "creation systems." You'll need to apply systems thinking across multiple logical levels. You'll identify these systems in your activities, and those of clients and suppliers. You will need to think about the numerous stakeholders of these systems and work with them, differentiating their interests, roles, and positions, and prepare accordingly different descriptions (models) of these systems. Throughout, it's essential not to confuse positions with roles.

It is important to emphasize that systems thinking is a specific behavior of the intellect, tackling new problems with which you are unfamiliar. For this, concepts and techniques of systems thinking are necessary.

People think using mastered concepts and techniques, describing the world, their work projects, and created systems through them. Therefore, systems thinking reproduces the knowledge of the "Systems Thinking" course just as mathematical thinking reproduces the knowledge of a mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks a systems language, formulates system descriptions, and creates successful systems. In systems thinking, the notion of a "successful system" involves considering the interests of all identified project roles related to that system during its creation.

Systems thinking brings universality, speed, and quality to solving new complex tasks when working with diverse stakeholders. It manifests in the speed of creating successful systems. For this, you must adeptly handle various interests, which are addressed through the formulation of a system description. Such consideration of different interests allows solving the most complex challenges faced by humanity or individuals across diverse fields.
