# What is Systems Thinking?

There is no single precise definition for "systems thinking," just as it is impossible to give a complete definition for the word "mother." We can say that systems thinking is the process of thinking during which the concept of a system and other concepts from the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack) are used. Or, that to think in a systems way is to think in the systems language [ ^1 ]. Or that systems thinking creates successful products and services by considering numerous interests [ ^2 ].

There is nothing supernatural, mystical, or esoteric about systems thinking. We will not delve into the structure of thought at the neural level or discuss various psychological aspects. We believe any form of thinking arises from studying certain theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real-life scenarios. These are the concepts you will study and apply in your professional and personal projects.

Why is systems thinking necessary?

Our world is complex and rapidly changing. But what precisely makes it complex and what exactly is changing so swiftly?

The complexity lies in the multitude of interests held by different people. Not only do these interests change quickly, but so do knowledge and working methods, workplaces, teams, and fields of activity. To create successful products and services, one must be able to work at the pace and complexity of the modern world. Systems thinking addresses this challenge.

For example, when designing a vehicle, you must consider the interests of the driver, passenger, pedestrian [ ^3 ], vehicle owner [ ^4 ], the automotive corporation [ ^5 ], aesthete [ ^6 ], environmentalist [ ^7 ], and the interests associated with several hundred other roles. Each interest is backed by a particular worldview (model, description). You can identify such interests within your own systems, whether it be a renovated apartment, a child raised and ready for adult life, a planted tree, an IT application, an enterprise, and so on.

In addition, in the modern world, we must quickly adapt to new conditions and learn new skills in the shortest possible time. Currently, everyone faces the constant challenge of mastering new practices or professions and exploring unfamiliar areas of activity, ideally without stress or delay.

Thinking mastery in systems thinking can help you understand a new area of activity within two weeks. Without it, one might take years. Why is this the case? A person using a systems approach will pay attention to the system of interest and other systems (supersystem, creation system, etc.), roles, methods, work artifacts, functional and modular parts, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and other focus objects present in any field. All these concepts can be found in IT, culinary arts, or infrastructure projects (transportation operations).

Humanity is heading towards the division of labor. Several centuries ago, there was a single role of "medicus" dealing with all human ailments. Now, medicine has several hundred (if not thousands) of roles. Such labor division occurs across all spheres of human activity. No one can master all roles deeply. Yet, understanding which specialists are necessary (and what roles they should perform in your projects) requires systems thinking. It allows you to segment the world into separate, yet interrelated systems and subsystems.

Developed systems thinking does more than quickly integrate into new worlds or projects; it allows for managing attention, discarding what's unimportant at the moment while maintaining a holistic vision. Our brain might lack the computing power to process all project details, necessitating focus on the right "place" and timely changes. Moreover, understanding the placement and interconnection of these "places" is essential. By applying systems thinking principles, you can reduce a meeting's duration from an hour to just 10 minutes [ ^8 ].

Although systems thinking aids in swiftly handling issues across various work areas, it doesn't replace applied mastery. However, it allows you to advance faster in your applied area and become a professional more quickly.

Systems thinking lets us break complex projects into simpler parts, link theory with practice, work effectively in large collectives, and organize our team. It assists in retaining all important project aspects in mind and special models [ ^9 ] and not forgetting them amidst the hustle.

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, enabling application to objects of varying complexity: from inert substances, living organisms, cyber-physical systems, individuals, organizations, communities, and even humanity as a whole.

We believe that systems thinking is essential for any contemporary individual wishing to advance their career and become a Chief Transformation Officer of a large business. Yet, its universal nature makes it suitable for the development of oneself, their child, community, and society.

What do the words "systems thinking" mean?

In the previous subsection, we already discussed that most people operate with a colloquial understanding of systems thinking and confuse the concepts of using a systems approach and systematicity.

Sometimes, systems thinking refers to an exceptional human ability, like combining analysis (understood as the ability to dive deep into details) and synthesis (understood as the ability to timely emerge from these details). This is what people describe as the ability to see the full picture. It's advantageous to possess such ability, just like it's good to be rich and healthy rather than sick and poor.

Unfortunately, such explanations aren't about "system" or the systems approach. Descriptions about needing to dive into details and emerge from them don't teach how to master and apply this method in everyday business, engineering, management, or other professional activities.

Systems thinking refers to human thinking that operates within a certain systems language. Systems thinking means thinking using the concept of a "system" and additional concepts established in specific transdisciplines of the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack). This includes conceptualization, ontology, physics, mathematics, among others. Moreover, systems thinking is about applying thought techniques of the systems approach.

There are many variations of the systems approach [ ^10 ]. Generally, an approach indicates that concepts, thought methods, and action techniques developed within one discipline (subject area) are subsequently applied to other disciplines and subject areas. Our version of the systems approach involves applying concepts, techniques, and methods from transdisciplines of the intellect stack to professional and personal areas [ ^11 ].

Systems approach refers to methodologies. In methodologies, the main concern is the approach, as it's about transferring knowledge. On the other hand, systems thinking is a human capability (with the emphasis on "thinking").

Human thinking is the mental (intellectual) activity by which we form a description of reality. This, in turn, helps carry out necessary actions, including the creation of products (systems) and services. To form such descriptions, we use words (terms, concepts). If you haven't specifically studied systems thinking, you're likely to use everyday language instead of the concepts from the modern intellect stack.

The difference between a layperson and a systems professional is that the latter operates with system concepts such as system, role, method (practice), work artifact, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergent properties, and others, which are studied in our course.

Just as with math, physics, marketing, or management, systems thinking must be learned. The first essential step in this education (as with any other) is to focus on the conceptual minimum and apply it in practice [ ^12 ].

Our course also trains thought techniques. Thought techniques refer to the ability to interlink various concepts and find physical objects in real projects associated with these concepts. For instance, find the *system of interest* and *creator*, delineate the link *"role-method (practice)-work artifact"*, and divide the system into *functional* and *modular* parts. That's why we recommend studying this course with mandatory modeling. By applying systems thinking concepts and techniques to a work project, the team saves time and resources to create a successful system and quickly aligns on substantive questions.

Throughout the process, you will need to learn to think simultaneously about the three interrelated systems: the "*system of interest*", "*supersystem*", and "*creation systems*". You will need to master systems thinking at several logical levels. It will be necessary to identify these systems in your activities, with clients, and with suppliers. You will need to address the numerous stakeholders of these systems, distinguish their interests, roles, and positions, and prepare different descriptions (models) of these systems for them accordingly. While doing so, do not confuse *positions* with *roles*.

It's important to emphasize that systems thinking is a specific form of intellectual behavior. Intelligence is responsible for solving new problems, those you haven't previously encountered. This is where systems thinking concepts and techniques are essential.

A person thinks using mastered concepts and techniques, using them to describe the world, work projects, and created systems. Therefore, it can be said that systems thinking reproduces the knowledge from the "Systems Thinking" course just as mathematical thinking reproduces the knowledge from a mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks a systems language, formulates system descriptions, and creates successful systems. In systems thinking, the notion of a "successful system" implies that during its creation, the interests of all identified project roles relevant to that system were considered.

Systems thinking brings universality, speed, and quality to solving new complex tasks when working with various stakeholders. Systems thinking is evident in the speed of creating successful systems. To achieve this, one must be adept at handling various interests, which are accommodated (satisfied) through the formation of a system description. Such consideration of different interests allows for solving the most complex challenges facing humanity or an individual. Moreover, in the most diverse fields of activity.

[ ^6 ]: The vehicle should be aesthetically pleasing.
[ ^7 ]: So that the vehicle does not pollute the environment.
[ ^8 ]: We don't discuss everything indiscriminately; instead, we skillfully manage attention and highlight focus objects for the entire team.
[ ^9 ]: Our course also trains you in modeling as a simulator.
[ ^10 ]: More about this can be learned in the "Systems Thinking" course.
[ ^11 ]: And accordingly to the disciplines necessary for realizing numerous professional and personal projects. We speak of the third generation of the systems approach.
[ ^12 ]: Without studying transdisciplines, systems thinking doesn't emerge solely from practice, or it would take decades.
