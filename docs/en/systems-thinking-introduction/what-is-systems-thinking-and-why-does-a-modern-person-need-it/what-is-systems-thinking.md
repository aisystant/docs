# What is Systems Thinking?

There is no single precise definition for "systems thinking," just as there can't be a single comprehensive definition for the term "mother." We can say that systems thinking involves using the concept of a system and other concepts from the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack). Or that thinking in a systems way is to think in the systems language [ ^1 ]. Or that systems thinking creates successful products and services by considering numerous interests [ ^2 ].

There's nothing supernatural, mystical, or esoteric about systems thinking. We will not delve into the structure of thinking on a neural level or discuss various psychological aspects. We believe that any kind of thinking can be developed through studying certain theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real life. These concepts are what you will learn and apply in your work and personal projects.

Why is systems thinking necessary?

Our world is complex and rapidly changing. But what makes it complex, and what exactly is changing quickly?

The complexity lies in the multitude of interests of different people. Not only do these interests change rapidly, but so do knowledge and work methods, work locations, teams, and fields of activity. To create successful products and services, one must be able to handle modern speed and complexity, which is where systems thinking helps.

For instance, when creating a car, it's necessary to consider the interests of the driver, passenger, pedestrian [ ^3 ], car owner [ ^4 ], and the automotive corporation [ ^5 ], along with those of aesthetes [ ^6 ] and environmentalists [ ^7 ], plus several hundred more roles. Behind each interest lies a particular worldview (model, description). You can identify similar interests in your systems, such as a renovated apartment, a child raised and ready for adult life, a planted tree, an IT application, a business, etc.

Moreover, in today's world, it's vital to quickly adapt to new conditions and learn new things in the shortest time possible. Nowadays, everyone must continually master new practices or professions, making sense of new fields without stress or delay.

Mastery in systems thinking can help you grasp a new area of activity in just two weeks. Someone without systems thinking might take several years to study it. Why does this happen? Because a person with systems thinking pays attention to the system of interest and other systems (supersystem, creation system, etc.), roles, methods, work artifacts, functional and modular parts, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and other objects of focus present in any field of activity. These listed concepts can be found in IT, in cooking, and in infrastructure projects (transportation operations).

Humanity is progressing through labor division. Several centuries ago, there was the single role of the "medicus," who dealt with all human diseases, and now there are hundreds (if not thousands) of roles in medicine. Such labor division happens in all areas of human activity. However, no one can deeply master all these roles. But to understand which specialists you need (and what roles they should play in your projects), systems thinking is required. It allows you to "slice" the world into distinct but interconnected systems and subsystems.

Established systems thinking not only helps quickly integrate into a new world or new projects but also manages attention, discarding what's unimportant at a given moment and maintaining a holistic vision. Our brain may lack the computational power to process all project details, so it's essential to focus all its resources on the "place" needed at the time and change this "place" as needed. Additionally, it's important to understand the principle of arranging and connecting all these "places" with each other. Understanding systems thinking can reduce meeting times from an hour to just ten minutes [ ^8 ].

Although systems thinking allows for quickly tackling problems in various work areas, it does not replace applied mastery. However, with systems thinking, you will progress faster in the applied field of activity and quickly become a professional.

Systems thinking allows us to break complex projects into simpler parts, connect theory and practice, work in large teams, and organize our team. It also helps us retain all important aspects of the project in mind and special modeling tools [ ^9 ], ensuring they aren't forgotten amidst the chaos.

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, allowing it to be applied to objects of varying complexity: inert substances, living beings, cyber-physical systems, individuals, organizations, communities, and even humanity as a whole.

We believe that systems thinking is essential for any modern person aspiring to make a career and become a Chief Transformation Officer of a large business. However, systems thinking is universal, thus applicable to self-development, child development, community, and society.

### What do the words "systems thinking" mean?

In the previous subsection, we already discussed that most people operate with a colloquial understanding of systems thinking and confuse the concepts of the use of a systems approach and systematicity.

Sometimes, "systems thinking" is assumed to be an outstanding human ability. For example, the ability to combine analysis (understood as the deep dive into details) and synthesis (understood as the ability to emerge from those details at the right time). This is what is known as the ability to see the big picture. It's good to have such an ability, just like being healthy and rich rather than sick and poor.

Unfortunately, such explanations aren't about "systems" or a systems approach. Narratives about the need to dive into details and emerge from them on time don't provide an opportunity to understand how to master this technique or apply it in everyday activities as entrepreneurs, engineers, managers, or other specialists.

Systems thinking entails human thinking operating with a specific systems language. Systems thinking is thinking that uses the concept of "system" and other concepts defined in specific transdisciplines of the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack), such as conceptualization, ontology, physics, mathematics, and others. It also involves using thought processes of a systems approach.

There are multiple variations of the systems approach [ ^10 ]. In general, an approach (approach) means that concepts, thinking methods, and action techniques developed within one discipline (subject area) are then applied to other disciplines and subject areas. Our version of the systems approach is the application of concepts, techniques, and methods of transdisciplines from the intellect stack to work and personal areas [ ^11 ].

The systems approach pertains to methodologies, where the main aspect is the approach-as-transfer-of-knowledge. And systems thinking is a human capability (the key here being the word "thinking").

Human thinking is an intellectual activity through which we form a description of reality. This helps carry out necessary actions, including creating products (systems) and services. To form such a description, we use words (terms, concepts). Unless you've specifically studied systems thinking, you'll likely use everyday words rather than concepts from the modern intellect stack.

The difference between a layperson and a systems professional is that the latter operates with system concepts such as system, role, method (practice), work artifact, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergent properties, and others, which are studied in our course.

Systems thinking requires special study, just like mathematics, physics, marketing, or management. And the first thing to do in this learning (as in any other) is to focus on the conceptual minimum and apply it in practice [ ^12 ].

In our course, thinking techniques are also practiced. Thinking techniques involve the ability to link different concepts with each other and identify physical objects in real projects associated with those concepts. For example, find the *system of interest* and *creator*, delineate the link '*role-**method (**practice**)**-work artifact**'*, and divide the system into *functional* and *modular* parts. That's why we recommend studying this course with mandatory modeling. By applying systems thinking concepts and techniques to a work project, the team saves time and resources on creating a successful system and quickly reaches substantive agreements.

You will need to learn to think simultaneously about three interrelated systems: the "*system of interest*", "*supersystem*", and "*creation systems*". You'll have to master systems thinking across several logical levels. You'll need to identify these systems in your activities, at clients, and suppliers. You'll have to consider multiple stakeholders of these systems, distinguish their interests, roles, and positions, and from there, prepare different descriptions (models) of these systems for them. Throughout, it's crucial not to confuse *positions* with *roles*.

It's important to emphasize that systems thinking represents a specific intellectual behavior. The intellect is responsible for solving new problems, those you've never encountered before. For this, systems thinking concepts and techniques are necessary.

People think using learned concepts and techniques, describing the world, work projects, and systems they create with them. Thus, systems thinking reproduces the knowledge from the "Systems Thinking" course, just as mathematical thinking reproduces knowledge from a mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks a systems language, formulates system descriptions, and creates successful systems. Within systems thinking, the term "successful system" means that when creating it, the interests of all identified project roles related to this system were considered.

Systems thinking brings universality, speed, and quality to solving new, complex tasks when working with different stakeholders. Systems thinking manifests in the speed of creating successful systems. To achieve this, one must be adept at handling various interests, which are accommodated (satisfied) through the formation of a system description. Such consideration of different interests allows solving the most challenging tasks humanity or an individual faces in the most diverse activity spheres.
