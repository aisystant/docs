# Systems Thinking: The Importance of Substance in Communication

**Systems Thinking** is extremely beneficial for large teams, especially when organizing the work of specialists from various fields. It is a method realized among people, aimed at facilitating their agreements with one another. Therefore, let's focus on communication.

In any communication, there is an exchange of information encompassing both the form of delivery and the content being conveyed. Individuals naturally react to different aspects of this exchange. To demonstrate the "form vs. content" idea, let's assume that an average person pays 80% of their attention to form and only 20% to content. (*Note: these percentages are illustrative.*)

A focused individual can shift this proportion, emphasizing content. This involves understanding from which role the person is speaking. Such a person consciously manages their attention, concentrating on the concepts and theories utilized by their **conversation partner**. In contrast, an ordinary person is guided by intuition, often evaluating communication through a "fight-or-flight" response. They may take offense at the form without delving into the content, which has the potential to positively impact their life.

If one's mind isn't trained to extract content, it defaults to focusing heavily on psychological-emotional aspects. Form is more quickly processed, requiring less effort. By observing form, one can infer content indirectly. However, it's crucial to see the essence beyond the form and to delve into the content, even under challenging circumstances. This requires acquiring **thinking mastery**, which is best cultivated systematically. While some may naturally gain it over time, being proactive and attempting to develop it systematically is more effective.

Students may complain about a teacher who presents information in a dull and uninteresting manner. While we understand the teacher's shortcomings, what should a student do? After all, they need the knowledge. Students will need to enhance their thinking mastery: controlling the natural inclination to focus on the form and striving to comprehend the content. Sometimes, it involves persevering through a strong urge to give up. It's best to abide by the principle: "Nothing personal, only the role interest."

Building thinking mastery through practice is essential, but one must also understand the theory of roles, focus management (concentration), ontology, and logic (understanding the domain with its concepts and terms). Begin applying this method of separating form from content in your communications.

Consider these examples highlighting the importance of content in communication:

1. In communication, adhere to grounding principles. Grounding, or relating to the physical world, involves conveying a representation of the world (systems) and it's crucial to ground your descriptions. This increases the likelihood of being understood. Tie abstract concepts and descriptions to tangible situations in the physical world. When abstract concepts arise, request examples of situations where they apply to avoid confusion and ensure clearer understanding. Find grounding examples in modeling exercises.

2. Everyone has a worldview model or models a specific situation based on their perspective. Even if unaware, individuals rely on theories they've learned or colloquial understandings (folk wisdom, memes, experience, or upbringing). To negotiate with them, pay attention to their ontology (terms they use) and create a suitable communication format. Ontological thinking helps avoid type errors, such as mixing the types "city" with "country" in phrases like "I visited Paris, London, and China," which can sound awkward. In systems thinking, avoid confusing types, like referring to cleaning as a system, or claiming a "manager plays the role of an engineer" without clarity.

3. Corporate culture is founded on values, mission, behavioral norms, traditions, and adopted theories. Language is at its core, reflecting the practices and knowledge embraced by the team. Notice the concepts personally used and those by your colleagues. To establish systems thinking, mastering the systems language is crucial. Learn to speak fluently, incorporate it into communication, and integrate it into corporate culture.

4. When discussing courses, note the form of content delivery. The form can be distinctly discussed, like the course being offered as a textbook or an online course in text or video format. Notice, we haven't mentioned the course content, which might be management, marketing, or swimming techniques. Content in any course involves specific discipline(s). For example, in systems thinking courses, while the discipline of "systems thinking" isn't taught directly, several disciplines from the intellect stack are explored, selecting concepts and principles to describe and develop approaches for dividing the world into systems and subsystems.

These elements show the significance of understanding not just form but also the substance of interactions to effectively navigate and enhance communication in any professional setting.
