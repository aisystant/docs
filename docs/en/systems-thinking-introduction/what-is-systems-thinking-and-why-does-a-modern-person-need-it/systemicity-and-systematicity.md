# The Use of a Systems Approach or Systems Thinking and Systematicity

Most people operate with a "colloquial" understanding of the concepts "system" and "systems thinking." They interpret 'the use of a systems approach or systems thinking' as mere personal organization, diligence, and the desire to anticipate every possible detail. That is misguided!

The use of a systems approach is often confused with a systematic approach — and systematically poor or incorrect thinking leads to disastrous results. Although many dictionaries define the use of a systems approach and systematicity as synonyms, we will differentiate between these concepts. Systematicity, regularity, and discipline mean that a person does something constantly, according to a schedule, while using a systems approach involves being able to focus one’s attention to "divide" the world into various systems and work with these systems and the diverse interests of people. This is a distinct mental (systems) technique that requires systematic training.

The use of a systems approach determines "what to do," while systematicity indicates that it needs to be done regularly, constantly, rhythmically. One concept does not replace the other. It is necessary to be both systems-oriented and systematic. This course discusses the use of a systems approach, while systematicity is covered in the course "Practices of Self-Development."

It is well known that in the world, everything is interconnected; that's why we identify systems by focusing our attention on them—just as we distinguish the parts of an elephant. However, using a systems approach is not just about ensuring that no detail is overlooked. It's crucial to single out what’s essential from the background and, conversely, integrate something important into the general context. Systems thinking directs the attention of a specialist or team during project implementation. Objects of focus are designated by specific concepts. [ ^1 ] Using these concepts, we distinguish both the important elements and contexts with our attention. Therefore, our course:

* Introduces several dozen such systems concepts;
* Teaches thinking techniques and the corresponding systems modeling that connect these concepts;
* Develops the skill of identifying these concepts in professional and personal projects.

We will highlight two systems thinking techniques that will be elaborated upon in the course.

The first technique focuses on how any activity can be viewed through three interconnected areas. These should address the following questions:

1. Why is it necessary, who benefits from it, and how will their behavior change if offered something new?
2. What is this new thing from a product (system) perspective, what are its characteristics, how is it structured, and how is it created?
3. Who and how will create the system, including which methods and resources will be used?

The second technique involves the relationship between analysis and synthesis or identifying the functions and structures of the system. In corporate culture, analysis is heavily emphasized. And this is right. However, we must not forget that analytical activity is just a part; synthesis is also needed. Analysis involves breaking down into parts, while synthesis involves combining and producing a work artifact (system). Systems thinking employs both functional analysis, which is dividing the system into functional parts, and modular synthesis, which is assembling a whole system from constructive parts. It is the work artifact or physical structure that constitutes something new and changes behavior (changes the world), and it is precisely for this that people pay.

Given the above, you need to prepare for the fact that many of your current notions will clash with the methodology of systems thinking. If you handle these discrepancies through thinking through writing (modeling), by the end of the course your worldview will be significantly updated.

[ ^1 ]: At the beginning of the previous subsection, such concepts as roles, methods, work artifacts, systems, architecture, etc., were mentioned. In this course, we will study several dozens of systems thinking concepts.
