# Intellect Stack and Self-Development Stack

Imagine you are tasked with understanding transportation operations, the banking sector, or IT. You may approach this problem based on your practical experience. However, if you are an IT specialist, roads might not be your area of expertise, and vice versa, a road engineer might not understand IT. Are you unfamiliar with banking terminology? Then you might not even know where to start. Yet, if you grasp systems thinking, your intellect will focus on objects that exist in any field of activity: roles, methods (practices)[ ^1 ], work artifacts, systems, architecture, and other systems concepts.

Intellect (thinking mastery) helps in coping with new problems, and thus, applied disciplines aren't suitable for its development[ ^2 ]. Intellect as a capability is demonstrated when dealing with something new: an unknown work problem, a personal life situation, or studying a new theory and mastering new tools. Even if it were possible to devise applied theories for all new problems, an individual could not know them all. Intellect aids in learning necessary theories, and strong intellect enables this much faster.

Every person has innate intellect, which predominantly develops in practice: children learn to handle new problems in their lives—crawling, walking, running, speaking, managing attention, etc. As individuals mature, knowledge becomes essential for the development of intellect. This isn’t about any disciplines, but rather about thinking theories that help tackle new problems. These differ from applied disciplines that solve specific classes of tasks. Therefore, we refer to these thinking disciplines as transdisciplines. A transdiscipline sets forth concepts and principles for several disciplines or areas of knowledge[ ^3 ].

The full list of transdisciplines within the intellect stack includes[ ^4 ]: 
1. Systems Engineering 
2. Methodology 
3. Rhetoric 
4. Ethics 
5. Aesthetics 
6. Research 
7. Rationality 
8. Logic 
9. Algorithmics 
10. Ontology 
11. Theory of Concepts 
12. Physics 
13. Mathematics 
14. Semantics 
15. Composure 
16. Conceptualization.

The intellect stack literally weaves intellect with certain concepts, principles, and thought techniques that help us think abstractly, adequately, consciously, rationally, and using systems thinking. It allows us to develop thought models, work with data, and act in the real world. Through the intellect stack, one can more easily and quickly understand new areas of work and life, concentrate, reason without obvious mistakes, and create successful systems.

At Aisystant, alongside the conscious development of intellect through the intellect stack, students are taught applied practices relevant to their role as learners. Just as a driver or manager has their own set of applied theories, there are applied practices for the role of a student—these are self-development practices.

The course "Practices of Self-Development" compiles such universal practices that you can use throughout your life (akin to arithmetic): investment and time management; systematic slow reading; thinking through writing; thinking by speaking; organizing leisure; forming an environment; strategizing; planning.

Conscious mastery of self-development practices is referred to as new or second literacy. We consider these practices personal practices of an educated individual in the 21st century who consciously engages in lifelong learning. The course "Practices of Self-Development" explains what "the skill of learning" entails and how the aforementioned practices form the mastery of self-development—a capability for independent and infinite development. If you master the practices of a learner well, they, alongside intellect, will also assist you in learning more quickly.

[ ^1 ]: The concepts of "method" and "practice" will be used synonymously in the course. However, note that in some cases, "practice" may refer to activities contrasted with theory.
[ ^2 ]: By studying operational management, accounting, or the butterfly stroke technique, you won't develop intellect. Of course, the more you learn and the more new problems you solve, the likelier it is that your intellect develops. But besides practical activities, theoretical knowledge is necessary. So, the development of intellect depends on both theory and practical activities.
[ ^3 ]: For example, the transdiscipline of mathematics provides mathematical language for other disciplines—physics, chemistry, etc. A transdiscipline is also a discipline, but often it's important to emphasize the relationship between different theories as "transdiscipline—discipline." There are also other classifications of knowledge, such as "fundamental and humanitarian."
[ ^4 ]: The order of transdisciplines in the intellect stack is approximate, and engaging with explanations requires knowledge from transdisciplines lower in the stack. The intellect stack represents a knowledge lattice where various transdisciplines and explanations are intertwined.
