# Core Concepts of Systems Thinking

Often, people who move to a different country and immerse themselves in another language are asked, "What language do you think in now?" Thinking in a given language means using that language as a tool for organizing thoughts, planning, reasoning, and engaging in internal dialogue [^1].

Language serves as a tool that can shape and structure cognitive processes. This concept is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis [^2]. It suggests that the language we speak influences our perception of the world and our thought processes.

When we talk about "language," most people immediately think of foreign languages, and few consider professional languages. For example, the language of a physicist or mathematician, a swimmer or driver, an engineer or manager. Essentially, a person learns not just Russian or English in their lifetime, but also professional languages. In essence, learning professional languages isn't vastly different from learning a conversational colloquial language.

Besides professional languages, there is also a meta-language or a systems language. In the systems language, there are specific words representing certain concepts. These concepts can be named differently in various foreign languages. For instance, a key systems thinking concept can be expressed by the word "система" or "system." Apart from the concept of system, there are other systems thinking concepts such as the system of interest, supersystem, function, architecture, role, method (practice), and so on.

Thus, one of the shortest answers to the question "What does systems thinking mean?" is "It’s when you think in the systems language." Further, it can be stated that systems thinking helps create successful products and services that consider multiple interests.

Learning systems thinking is as essential as learning any foreign language. This means that one must study the concepts (words) and apply them to projects and life. It's crucial to immerse oneself in the environment, which is why being part of a community of like-minded people is vital [^3]. Of course, one must first take this education seriously and realize the importance of mastering the systems language. For fluency, it takes years.

However, as with a foreign language, new opportunities arise. These opportunities are more significant, as the systems language opens doors to any professional language and the creation of successful systems in both work and personal life. Moreover, you will be able to master these professions more quickly in any foreign language.

Therefore, study the systems methodology and think in the systems language, not just in everyday Russian or English!

One of the main skills of a modern person is the ability to learn quickly. Humans do this much faster than any other animal on Earth. However, some people learn faster than others, thus making fewer mistakes and living better lives. To learn quickly, one must understand that education is primarily about studying theories. And of course, theories must be linked to practical activities. The best theories help humanity move civilization forward.

Any theory, in turn, consists of specific concepts that describe the world. These are the concepts one should pay attention to when studying theories. They should be directly noted and connected with each other during course studies, as well as being identified in the physical world.

In physics, concepts such as physical body, speed, and force are introduced. These concepts are essential to describe natural phenomena, the structure, and the evolution of the material world. In accounting, concepts like asset, liability, and double-entry bookkeeping are introduced to describe enterprise activities (balance sheet) for tax accounting. In the course on systems thinking, concepts necessary for creating successful systems and organizing a large team of specialists from various professions are gathered.

Can systems be created without systems thinking concepts? Of course, they can. But it is akin to ignoring the laws of physics or learning to swim only through practice, without understanding the theory of freestyle. You would still achieve something. We offer an intellectual language to explain and change the world, competing with other schools of thought.

With systems thinking concepts, you can work not only more swiftly, increasing the complexity of the systems created, but you can also apply these concepts to creating entirely different systems: IT systems, an airplane, or a house, a nuclear plant, or a child ready for adult life.

Try to independently assess your level of mastery of systems thinking concepts. At least internally express them, and preferably write drafts for each item with systems thinking concepts. Herein lies a large portion of the concepts studied in Aisystant courses. They are grouped to facilitate not just description, but also explanation in terms of their distinction from other similar concepts.

1. The use of a systems approach or systems thinking and systematicity
2. Synergy and emergent properties
3. Physical world and mental space
4. Nestedness and hierarchy
5. Description, implementation, and system documentation
6. Alpha and work artifact
7. Works and methods (practices)
8. Functional analysis and modular synthesis
9. Processes, projects, and tasks
10. Physical object (executor/performer), functional object (role), and function (behavior)
11. Word, object, and system
12. Function and structure
13. Intention, subject of interest, and preference
14. Role, subject of interest, role interest (preference), and method of description
15. Discipline and tools
16. Function and service
17. Improvement and development
18. Strategy and strategizing
19. Work management and method (practice) management
20. Black and transparent boxes
21. Architecture and non-architecture
22. Systems of systems and people in systems
23. Systems-oriented and traditional leadership
24. Stages and phases of a project
25. Transdiscipline and discipline, method and theory
26. Role, executor/performer, rank, and position
27. Role, method (practice), and work artifact
28. Dissatisfaction and subject of interest
29. Entrepreneur, engineer, and manager
30. System levels, creation chains, areas of interest
31. Work management: project management, process management, and case management
32. Organizational roles and organizational units
33. System architecture and enterprise architecture
34. Models, metamodels, multimodels, megamodels
35. Modeling and meta-modeling
36. Meta-system transition and emergence
37. System of interest, supersystem, creation system, surrounding systems, our system, subsystem
38. Successful system and ethics
39. Subject of interest, method of description, description

This exercise is beneficial both during and after completing each Aisystant course. By mastering each concept, you will not only be able to find a common language with entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers but also acquire new professional knowledge faster, becoming a sought-after specialist.
