# Classic Systems Approach 1.0

At the heart of the systems approach lies the concept of a "system." Through this lens, the constructor thinks about the world of objects or things [ ^1 ]. This can be likened to physics, where the concept of a "physical body" is introduced. It refers to a material object with mass, shape, and volume. In physics, all reasoning and laws are associated with a physical body, and when physical laws are applied in practice, the "physical body" is replaced by a corresponding material object: a road, a chair, a rocket, or an engine piston.

The same applies to the concept of a "system." Every professional works with their unique systems. For some, a system might be a house, a computer program, or a trained artificial intelligence. For others, it could be a child ready for adulthood, or a cultivated tree or grove. Every person, consciously or unconsciously, creates systems. A systems constructor does this consciously, relying on various systems methodologies.

In specific projects, "systems" are distinguished from the physical world by the attention of an individual or team. Systems thinking is the capability to identify systems, describe, and create them [ ^2 ], and to execute specific actions with them. The systems approach offers methodologies based on the concept of a "system" to develop systems thinking. There are several generations of the systems approach, each containing different methodologies [ ^3 ]. What unifies all methodologies of every generation is the presence of the concept of a "system."

In the first version of the systems approach [ ^4 ], formulated by L. von Bertalanffy, systems are considered as objects representing a specific class. Consider the "clock" as a system. Notice that it is somewhat ideal (though we imagine clocks as physical), rather than a specific physical object that can be pointed to. We don't talk about a wristwatch or a clock on a space station. The objective examination of systems implied that systems were objects and were discussed independently of subjects. Therefore, in the systems approach 1.0, you can discuss simply clocks, tables, or cars and identify different properties within these systems—integrity, emergence, nestedness. The classic approach primarily examines these three properties of any system.

A person cannot consider the entire world at once; their brain lacks the computational power. People highlight what is important from reality with their attention, striving not to lose the connection of this important element with the world as a whole, meaning not losing context. The concept of a "system" allows one to manage attention, which is why systems thinking is sometimes described as the ability to manage attention.

The property of "integrity" implies that a system has a boundary, and the connection between the parts of the system is much stronger than with other objects of physical reality. This property helps to focus attention on systems. Simple objects like tables or cars pose no problems with boundaries, but when considering complex systems (like an airport or a university), finding boundaries is not easy. Understanding what constitutes the water safety system, the pass issuance system, or the heating system is challenging. We'll discuss complex systems more later.

The second important property of systems is emergence. In English, "emerge" means to appear. Emergence implies that a system has developed a new property (function) that none of its individual parts possessed. For instance, the motor, chassis, and cabin together form the system of a car, which then has the function of transporting a passenger. None of the car's parts have this function alone. It arises when all subsystems come together. Any system has the property of emergence, and if it lacks such a function, it is not a system.

The third property of classic systems is nestedness [ ^5 ]. Nestedness can be imagined as a matryoshka doll: one system is contained within another, which for it is a supersystem. The property of nestedness means that any system itself is a supersystem for some subsystems, and it also fits into a larger supersystem. If we claim to have a system, it automatically has subsystems and a supersystem.

All three mentioned properties of the classic systems approach help to identify the necessary objects from the physical world, maintain focus on the system itself, and if necessary, consider its structure (subsystems), while also retaining the system's link to the physical world (supersystem).

Let's consider an example—the system of a "clock." Firstly, you can always picture this system in the physical world. A clock possesses the property of integrity; it has a boundary. Clocks have the emergent property, meaning they have a function—to show time. This function emerges only when all parts of the clock are assembled together. None of the clock parts singularly have this property. Nestedness is evident in that each element of the clock is part of the entire system. Similarly, the clock face itself also has subsystems. Each subsystem will have its own properties of integrity, emergence, and nestedness.

Thus, the classic systems approach establishes a certain way of thinking or worldview through system properties, which we will utilize in the subsequent generations of the systems approach 2.0 and 3.0.

[ ^1 ]: Do not confuse the physical world with the mental space. A person is an object of the physical world, while the concept of "age" is an abstract object.

[ ^2 ]: By involving professionals in applied methods.

[ ^3 ]: Although all systems methodologies are based on the concept of a "system," they may use their unique set of concepts. Apart from differences in concept sets, methodologies also differ by generations of the systems approach.

[ ^4 ]: There are several methodologies, whose founders include Alexander Bogdanov, Edward de Bono, Peter Drucker, Alfred Chandler, and others.

[ ^5 ]: We will speak about the nestedness of physical systems within one another. This relation of nestedness between two physical objects as "part-whole" differs from the relations of "class-member" and "superclass-subclass."
