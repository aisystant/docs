# Systems Approach 2.0

In the classic systems approach, systems were viewed as material objects possessing three properties: integrity (of a system), emergent properties, and nestedness[^1]. However, these systems were treated as ideal physical objects, detached from human interests. The connection to human interests emerged in what is known as Systems Approach 2.0, which is based on entirely different systems methodologies compared to the first generation[^2].

Systems Approach 2.0 does not reject the classic system properties introduced in the first generation. While they remain necessary conditions for a system's existence, they are no longer sufficient. In modern interpretations, the concept of "system" acquires new additional properties stemming from a subjective view of the system.

As previously mentioned, the classic approach is more abstract and considers ideal objects, whereas the second-generation systems approach is pragmatic, dealing with objects needed for specific purposes or affecting certain people.

Systems Approach 2.0 is not used to have theoretical discussions about a table, clock, or car without a real project. These discussions resemble ideal objects within a mental space often lacking specific physical objects required by specific people in particular projects.

Systems thinking emerges when discussing systems such as "office table," "wristwatch," and "passenger vehicle." In such cases, one can at least speak about the interests and roles of stakeholders who desire something from these systems. Based on this, the system, its boundaries, and how it will be used are determined.

In Systems Approach 2.0, all project roles that somehow influence the system or individuals in certain roles who may be affected by it are recognized as stakeholders. The collective interests of all project roles dictate the system's design, its function, its composition, and so on.

The underlying thought process is "No interests—no system." For instance, an automotive corporation designs a passenger vehicle considering potential clients' interests in roles such as driver, passenger, user, owner, pedestrian, regulatory bodies, environmentalists, etc. Whether it will be a passenger or cargo vehicle, what type of engine it will have, or its load capacity depends on the interests of the stakeholders.

Each considered interest defines what the vehicle should be like. Without an environmental interest, there would be no need to install a gas emission control subsystem that meets Euro-6 standards. Installing such a subsystem alters the system's design.

Everything installed in a passenger vehicle responds to some project role interest that the automaker decided to address. The system "passenger vehicle" will be successful if the interests of all stakeholders (project roles) are considered (satisfied).

Let's further discuss this systems thinking strategy: first look 'outward,' and only then 'inward' into the system.

The interaction between the system and project roles determines its boundary (integrity), function, and design. Therefore, system discussions don't start with the internal setup but rather with understanding its environment. This means looking at which supersystem the system belongs to, who needs it, and what these stakeholders require, what problems and interests they have regarding the system. Hence, a significant system principle arises: always start by looking outside the system, only then go inside.

For example, with the classic consideration of the "clock" system, one would start delving into the system's properties, focusing inward, i.e., discussing its components. In modern consideration, it is essential to start by looking outside the system—considering which supersystem the clock is part of, who needs it, and how it's utilized.

After this examination, it's clear whether we're discussing a wristwatch, a cuckoo clock, or a tower clock, and each of these clocks will have a different design. Without listing and understanding the interests of stakeholders, it is impossible to talk about the system's design.

Thus, in Systems Approach 2.0, systems not only possess properties like integrity (of a system), emergent properties, and nestedness, but their crucial attribute is their dependency on stakeholders (project roles). The success of the system depends on satisfying the interests of the project roles; therefore, consideration starts with the environment: first, look outward, and only then inward into the system.

[^1]: Do not confuse "nestedness" and "hierarchy." The latter concept may appear in first-generation system property descriptions but is incorrect. Hierarchy is a broader principle than nestedness. Nestedness is a specific case of hierarchy; not all hierarchy implies nestedness. For example, a boss and subordinate are hierarchical but not nested.
[^2]: In the second, as in the first-generation systems approach, various systems methodologies exist. Each has its set of concepts and thinking techniques. However, their common distinguishing feature is that in addition to the concept of "system," each employs the concept of "role," "stakeholder," or "interested parties." One such second-generation systems methodology is the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).
