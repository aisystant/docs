title: Systems Approach 2.0
---

In the classical systems approach, systems were viewed as material objects possessing three properties: integrity (of a system), emergence, and nestedness^[Do not confuse "nestedness" with "hierarchy." The latter term may appear in descriptions of first-generation system properties, but it is incorrect. Hierarchy is a broader principle than nestedness. Nestedness is a specific case of hierarchy, meaning not all hierarchies imply nestedness. For example, a boss and subordinate represent a hierarchy, but not nestedness.]. However, these systems were considered ideal physical objects, not connected to human interests. The connection with human interests appeared in what is known as Systems Approach 2.0, which is based on entirely different systems methodologies compared to the first generation^[In both the first and second generation of systems approach, diverse systems methodologies exist. Each has its own set of concepts and thinking practices. However, their distinctive feature is the inclusion of terms such as "role," "stakeholder," or "interested parties" along with the concept of "system." One of the second-generation systems methodologies is the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).].

The Systems Approach 2.0 does not reject the classical properties of a system introduced in the first generation. It considers these as necessary conditions for its existence, but now they are insufficient. In modern interpretations, the concept of "system" acquires new additional properties derived from a subjective view of the system.

As we mentioned earlier, the classical approach is more abstract and considers ideal objects, whereas the second-generation systems approach is pragmatic and deals with objects needed by or affecting certain people.

Systems Approach 2.0 is not applied when there's no actual project to discuss objects like tables, clocks, or vehicles. This is more akin to the ideal objects of mental space, often without representing specific physical objects needed by particular people in specific projects.

Systems thinking emerges when we talk about systems like "office desk," "wristwatch," or "passenger vehicle." In this case, at least we can discuss the interests and involved roles that desire something from these systems. Based on this, the system is defined, its boundaries are established, and how it will be used is determined.

In Systems Approach 2.0, all project roles influencing the system or people in certain roles it may affect are regarded as interested parties. The aggregate of all project roles' interests determines what the system will be, its function, and its components.

The thinking technique is: "No interestsâ€”no system." For example, an automotive corporation creates a passenger vehicle considering the potential clients' interests in roles such as driver, passenger, user, owner, pedestrians, regulatory bodies, environmental advocates, etc. Whether it will be a passenger vehicle or a truck, what type of engine it will have, or its load capacity depends on the interests of the stakeholders.

Each considered interest defines what the vehicle should be. If there were no environmental interest, there would be no need to install an exhaust gas cleaning subsystem that complies with the Euro-6 standard. Including such a subsystem in the vehicle changes the system's design.

Everything installed in a passenger vehicle is a response to a project role's interest that the automaker decided to address. The passenger vehicle system will be successful if the interests of all stakeholders (project roles) are taken into account and addressed.

Let's further discuss a systems thinking technique: first looking "outward" and only then "inward" at the system.

The system's boundary (integrity), function, and structure depend on its interaction with project roles. Therefore, the discussion of the system begins not with the internal structure but with an understanding of its environment. This means identifying which supersystem the system belongs to, who needs it, what these interested parties require, and their problems and interests concerning the system. This leads to an important systems principle: always start by looking outside the system, then look inside.

For example, in the classical consideration of the "clock" system, one might start examining the system's properties by looking inside it, discussing what it consists of. In the modern view, it is necessary to begin by looking outward, identifying what supersystem the clock is part of, who needs it, and how it is used.

After such consideration, it becomes clear whether the discussion is about wristwatches, cuckoo clocks, or tower clocks. Each of these clocks will have a different design. Without listing and understanding the interests of the stakeholders, it's impossible to discuss the system's design.

Thus, in the Systems Approach 2.0, systems possess not only the properties of integrity, emergence, and nestedness. Crucially, systems depend on stakeholders (project roles). The system's success depends on addressing the interests of project roles, which is why the examination begins with the surroundings: first looking outside, then inward at the system.
