# System Function

Separating the physical world from mental space helps us understand the difference between a system and its function. For example, a car is a tangible object that exists in the real world. It is the embodiment of a system or a physical object that we can touch. Like any system, a car has a function, and in this case, it is movement. Movement, like any system function, is abstract and cannot be touched. However, we can observe movement, or more precisely, we see the car moving.

Function (or behavior, or action) is assigned by people; things do not choose their own functions. A hammer does not assign itself the function of driving nails. An interested party might take a microscope and designate (name) it as a "hammer," thereby assigning it the function of driving nails. In this scenario, the hammer becomes merely a role for the microscope or even a stone. Therefore, the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role is driving nails.

People are not so much interested in the object itself (the material object) as they are in its function. This is where its value lies for interested parties, although laypeople rarely share this perspective. A system skill involves the specific examination and discussion of a function that is needed by someone, as well as the structure (physical object) that best fulfills this function.

The cognitive method of separating a system and its function can be applied to thinking itself. We can say that thinking is a function of the intellect. In this context, intellect is the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
