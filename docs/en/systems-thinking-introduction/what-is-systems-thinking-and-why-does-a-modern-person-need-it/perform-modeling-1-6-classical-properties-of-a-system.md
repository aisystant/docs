# Complete the modeling exercise: 1.6. Classical Properties of a System

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If needed, review the theoretical material again. Note that the "System" column provides examples of ideal objects. Recall the difference between the classic systems approach and systems approach 2.0, and specifically, what it means to have an objective and subjective consideration of a system.

Describe the properties of the systems indicated in the table. You may also come up with your own examples. Highlight the classical properties of systems from work and personal projects.

If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, write down reflections or questions that can later be asked in support chats.

Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all of its items.
