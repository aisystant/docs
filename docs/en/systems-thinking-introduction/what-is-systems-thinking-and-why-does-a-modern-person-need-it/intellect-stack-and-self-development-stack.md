# Intellect Stack and Self-Development Stack

Imagine you've been assigned to understand transportation operations, banking, or IT. You might approach the issue using your practical experience. However, as an IT specialist, roads might not be your area of expertise, and conversely, a road specialist might not grasp IT concepts. Are you unfamiliar with banking terminology? In that case, you may not even know where to start. But if you possess systems thinking, your intellect will focus on the entities present in any field of activity: roles, methods (practices) [ ^1 ], work artifacts, systems, architecture, and other systems concepts. 

Intellect (thinking mastery) aids in handling new problems, which is why applied disciplines are not suitable for its development [ ^2 ]. Intellect as a capability is demonstrated when addressing something new: an unfamiliar work problem and a personal life situation, or learning a new theory and mastering new tools. Even if it were possible to devise applied theories for all new problems, no individual could know them all. Intellect assists in learning the necessary theories, and a strong intellect allows this to happen much faster.

Every person has an inherent intellect that primarily develops through practice: children learn to handle new problems in their lives—crawling, walking, running, speaking, managing attention, and so on. As one matures, knowledge becomes significant for intellectual development. Not just any disciplines, but thinking theories that help tackle new problems. These differ from applied disciplines, which address specific classes of problems. We call such thinking disciplines transdisciplines. A transdiscipline sets concepts and principles for several disciplines or areas of knowledge [ ^3 ].

The full list of transdisciplines in the intellect stack includes [ ^4 ]: 
1. Systems Engineering
2. Methodology
3. Rhetoric
4. Ethics
5. Aesthetics
6. Research
7. Rationality
8. Logic
9. Algorithmics
10. Ontology
11. Theory of Concepts
12. Physics
13. Mathematics
14. Semantics
15. Composure
16. Conceptualization.

The intellect stack literally ingrains the intellect with certain concepts, principles, and thinking techniques that help us think abstractly, adequately, consciously, rationally, and using systems thinking. It enables the development of thinking models, the ability to work with data, and action in the real world. Using the intellect stack makes it easier and quicker to understand new work and life domains, concentrate and reason without obvious mistakes, and create successful systems.

At Aisystant, besides consciously developing intellect through the intellect stack, learners are taught the applied practices of the student's role. The role of a driver or manager comes with its own set of applied theories they master. Similarly, applied practices are distinguished for the student's role—these are self-development practices.

The course "Self-Development Practices" consolidates such universal practices that you can use throughout your life (much like arithmetic): investment and time management; systematic slow reading; thinking through writing; thinking by speaking; organizing leisure; forming an environment; strategizing; planning.

Conscious command of self-development practices is what we call new or second literacy. We consider these practices to be personal practices of a culturally adept person of the 21st century who consciously learns throughout their life. The course "Self-Development Practices" provides insights into what it means to "know how to learn" and how the aforementioned practices form mastery in self-development or the ability to independently and continually develop. If you are proficient in student practices, along with your intellect, they will also help you learn faster.

[ ^1 ]: The terms "method" and "practice" will be used interchangeably in the course. However, note that in some cases, the word "practice" refers to activities that contrast with theory.

[ ^2 ]: Studying operational management, accounting, or the crawl method will not develop intellect. Of course, the more you learn and the more new problems you solve, the more likely your intellect will develop. But besides practical activities, it's necessary to know the theory. Thus, the development of intellect depends on both theory and practical activities.

[ ^3 ]: For example, the transdiscipline of mathematics provides the mathematical language for other disciplines such as physics, chemistry, etc. A transdiscipline is also a discipline, but often it's important to emphasize such a relationship between different theories as "transdiscipline-discipline." Other classifications of knowledge exist, such as "fundamental and humanities."

[ ^4 ]: The order of transdisciplines in the intellect stack is approximate, and employing explanations requires knowledge from transdisciplines lower in the stack. The intellect stack is a lattice of knowledge where different transdisciplines and explanations are interwoven.
