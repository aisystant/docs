# Intellect Stack and Self-Development Stack

Let's imagine you're tasked with understanding **transportation operations**, the banking sector, or IT. It's likely you'll approach these problems based on your practical experience. However, if you're an IT specialist, roads might not be your area of expertise, and vice versa—someone in transportation likely doesn't understand IT. And perhaps you're also not very familiar with banking terminology? In that case, you may not even know where to begin. But if you possess systems thinking, your intellect will draw attention to objects that exist in any field of activity: roles, methods (practices)^[The terms "method" and "practice" will be used interchangeably in the course. However, note that in some cases, the word "practice" refers to activities contrasted with theory.], work artifacts, systems, architecture, and other **systems concept**.

Intellect (or **thinking mastery**) helps address new challenges, and therefore, applied disciplines are not suitable for its development^[Studying operational management, accounting, or the backstroke won't develop your intellect. Of course, the more you learn and the more new problems you solve, the more likely your intellect will develop. But in addition to practical activities, you also need theoretical knowledge. Thus, the development of intellect depends on both theory and practical activity.]. Intellect as a capability is demonstrated when it's necessary to deal with something new: an unknown work problem, a personal life situation, or studying a new theory and mastering new tools. Even if it were possible to invent applied theories for every new problem, no single person could know them all. Intellect aids in studying necessary theories, and strong intellect allows for this to happen much faster.

Every person has innate intellect, which primarily develops in practice: children learn to cope with new life challenges—crawling, walking, running, speaking, directing attention, and so forth. As they grow, knowledge becomes important for the development of intellect. This doesn't refer to just any disciplines, but to cognitive theories that help manage new problems. This distinguishes them from applied disciplines that solve a specific class of tasks. Therefore, we call such cognitive disciplines transdisciplines. A transdiscipline sets concepts and principles for multiple disciplines or fields of knowledge^[For example, the transdiscipline of mathematics provides a mathematical language for other disciplines—such as physics, chemistry, etc. A transdiscipline is also a discipline, but often it is important to highlight this relationship between different theories as "transdiscipline-discipline." There are also other classifications of knowledge, such as "fundamental and humanities".].

The full list of transdisciplines in the intellect stack includes^[The order of presentation of transdisciplines in the intellect stack is approximate, and explaining requires knowledge from transdisciplines lower in the stack. Meanwhile, the intellect stack represents a web of knowledge in which various transdisciplines and explanations are interwoven.]: 
1. Systems Engineering
2. Methodology
3. Rhetoric
4. Ethics
5. Aesthetics
6. Research
7. Rationality
8. Logic
9. Algorithmics
10. Ontology
11. Theory of Concepts
12. Physics 
13. Mathematics
14. Semantics
15. Composure
16. Conceptualization.

The intellect stack literally threads intellect with certain concepts, principles, and thinking techniques that help us think abstractly, adequately, consciously, rationally, and using a systems approach. It allows for developing thinking models, working with data, and acting in the real world. Through the intellect stack, one can more easily and quickly understand new fields of work and life, focus, and reason without making **obvious mistakes**, creating successful systems.

**At Aisystant**, alongside the conscious development of intellect through the intellect stack, there is teaching in the **applied practices** of the student's role. A driver or manager's role has its own set of applied theories that they master. Similarly, applied practices are distinguished for the student role—these are self-development practices.

The course "Self-Development Practices" comprises such universal practices that you can use throughout your life (just like arithmetic): time investment and accounting; systematic slow reading; **thinking through writing**; **thinking by speaking**; organizing leisure; forming an environment; strategizing; planning.

Conscious mastery of self-development practices is what we call new or second literacy. We consider these practices to be personal practices of a cultured 21st-century individual who consciously learns throughout their life. The course "Self-Development Practices" allows one to understand what it means to "know how to learn" and how the aforementioned practices form the mastery of self-development or the ability to independently and endlessly develop. If you are proficient in the practices of a student, along with intellect, they will also help you learn faster.
