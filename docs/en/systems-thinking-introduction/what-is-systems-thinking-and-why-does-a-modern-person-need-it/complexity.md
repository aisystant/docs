# Complexity

Systems thinking deals with complexity. Complexity is a concept that has multiple meanings in various contexts and theories. We will discuss complexity in the following contexts:

* When encountering something new and unknown, it is inherently complex because we lack ready-made methods to handle it;
* When a complexly structured system is created or exists, consisting of a large number of elements with numerous connections, such as the "Enterprise of 1000 people" system or the "Electric Vehicle" system;
* When a system has a large number of stakeholders who either influence it or are influenced by it. Such a system is likely to be complexly structured, but we distinguish this third type of complexity separately to emphasize the many interests in the system that must be accounted for to create a successful system.

Systems thinking helps continuously increase the complexity you can manage throughout life. Besides the ability to work with complexity, a system constructor enhances the speed of work. But first, one needs to acquire fluency (speed) in applying systems thinking. This requires progressively complicating the systems examination across different kinds:

1. Begin by considering simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer";
2. Then discuss your own body and personal mastery;
3. Next, move to IT systems (cyber-physical systems), where software equates to personality, and "mastery" is one of the applications/application programs in this software [ ^1 ];
4. Afterward, shift to teams and enterprises;
5. Ultimately, access high system levels—community, society, humanity...

We do not recommend immediately trying to apply systems thinking to your most complex project. Doing so might only confuse you more and waste time. Try tackling the simplest project first, and once you reach fluency, transition to a more complex system.

In our course, we largely rely on simple systems, while in the courses “Systems Thinking,” “Methodology,” and “Systems Engineering,” you will consolidate this understanding and see similarities with other systems. Upon completing the “Personality Engineering” course, you'll be able to understand personality, and after successfully completing the “Systems Management” course, you can become a Chief Transformation Officer of an enterprise. Courses on higher systems levels are under development.

This phased approach trains the ability to consistently raise the threshold of complexity and speed. Of course, we all want everything at once, but that rarely happens in real life. Training systematicity alongside a systems approach will be your competitive advantage, ensuring life does not become boring. A systems thinker with agency [ ^2 ] will always have a motivated desire and the capacity to do something remarkable and necessary for people, elevating complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of infinite development and personal self-development.

[ ^1 ]: If you are not an IT specialist, the analogy with personality will help you understand a lot about IT. The human body can be seen as IT hardware, and specific mastery (as part of personality) is the software.

[ ^2 ]: Agency is the ability to set goals and act to improve one's current state. To do this, an agent actively influences both themselves and the surrounding world. Agency can be compared to "having a fire under one's butt."
