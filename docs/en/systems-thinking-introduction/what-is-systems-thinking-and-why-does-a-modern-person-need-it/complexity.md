# Complexity

Systems thinking deals with complexity. Complexity is a concept with many meanings across different contexts and theories. We will discuss complexity in the following settings:

* when we encounter something new and unknown, it is inherently complex because we don't have ready-made methods to deal with it;
* a complexly structured system is created or exists, such as one consisting of a large number of elements with numerous connections, etc. This could be a "1,000-person enterprise" system or an "electric vehicle" system;
* the system has a large number of stakeholders who either influence the system or are influenced by it. Such a system is likely to be complexly structured, but we have highlighted this third type of complexity separately to draw attention to the numerous interests in the system that need to be considered in order to create a successful system.

Systems thinking helps continually increase the complexity you can handle throughout your life. In addition to the ability to work with complexity, a system constructor increases the speed of work. But first, you need to acquire fluency (speed) in applying systems thinking. To achieve this, it's necessary to gradually complicate the systemic examination of different types of systems:

1. start with simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer";
2. then discuss your body and personal mastery;
3. move on to IT systems (cyber-physical systems), where software is akin to personality, and "mastery" is one of the applications/application programs within this software [ ^1 ];
4. then to teams and enterprises;
5. finally, gain access to higher system levels—community, society, humanity…

We do not recommend attempting to apply systems thinking to your most complex project right away. Doing so will only confuse you further and waste your time. Try working on the simplest project first, and once you achieve fluency, move on to a more complex system.

In our course, we primarily focus on simple systems, while in the "Systems Thinking," "Methodology," and "Systems Engineering" courses, you will solidify this understanding and see similarities with other systems. By the end of the "Personal Engineering" course, you will be able to comprehend personality, and after successfully completing the "Systems Management" course, you could become a Chief Transformation Officer. Courses on higher system levels are under development.

This step-by-step approach trains your ability to continually raise the threshold of complexity and speed. Of course, we all want everything at once, but that rarely happens. You must train systematicity along with the use of a systems approach—this will be your competitive advantage and ensure that life won't be dull. A systems thinker with agency [ ^2 ] will always have the motivated desire and capability to create something extraordinary and necessary for people, elevating complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of infinite development and personal self-development.

[ ^1 ]: If you're not an IT specialist, the analogy with personality will help you understand a lot about IT. The human body can be seen as IT hardware, and specific mastery (as part of personality) as software.

[ ^2 ]: Agency is the ability to set goals and act to improve one's current state. For this, an agent actively influences both themselves and the surrounding world. Agency can be compared to "having a fire under one's butt."
