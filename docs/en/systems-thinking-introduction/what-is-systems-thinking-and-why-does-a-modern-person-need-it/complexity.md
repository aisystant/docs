**Systems Thinking and Complexity**

Systems thinking deals with complexity—a concept with multiple meanings across different contexts and theories. We'll explore complexity in the following contexts:

- When we encounter something new and unknown, it is inherently complex because we lack pre-established methods to address it.
- A complex system is created or already exists, one comprised of a large number of elements with extensive interconnections, such as an "Enterprise with 1,000 employees" or an "Electric Vehicle."
- The system involves many stakeholders who are either impacted by or have an impact on it. Such a system will likely be complex, but we highlight this type of complexity to emphasize the multitude of interests that need to be considered to create a successful system.

Systems thinking equips you to continually increase the level of complexity you can manage throughout your life. Beyond mastering complexity, a system constructor can enhance the speed of work. However, fluency in applying systems thinking must be achieved first. To develop this fluency, you should gradually increase the complexity of your systems examination:

1. Begin with simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer."
2. Then consider your own body and personal mastery.
3. Move to IT systems (cyber-physical systems) where software represents personality, and "mastery" is one of the application programs within it.^[If you are not an IT specialist, this analogy will give you an understanding of IT. The human body can be seen as IT hardware, and particular mastery (as part of personality) is the software.]
4. Next, focus on teams and enterprises.
5. Finally, gain access to high system levels—community, society, humanity...

We advise against immediately applying systems thinking to your most complex project. Doing so might lead to confusion and wasted time. Instead, start with a simple project and only move on to more complex systems once you've achieved fluency.

In our course, we focus primarily on simple systems. In the courses on "Systems Thinking," "Methodology," and "Systems Engineering," you'll reinforce this understanding and see parallels with other systems. Upon completing the "Personal Engineering" course, you'll gain insights into personality, and after successfully finishing the "Systems Management" course, you could become a Chief Transformation Officer. Courses addressing higher system levels are in development.

This phased approach trains your ability to continuously raise the threshold of complexity and speed. Although it may be tempting to tackle everything at once, real life rarely allows for this. You need to train systematicity alongside a systems-oriented approach—this will be your competitive advantage and ensure life remains engaging. A systems thinker with agency^[Agency is the ability to set goals and act to improve one's current state. An agent actively influences themselves and the surrounding world. Agency can be likened to "having a fire under one's butt."] will always have the motivated desire and capability to accomplish something extraordinary and valuable to people, elevating complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of endless development and personal self-development.
