# Why and What to Learn in the Modern World

# Lifelong Learning and Systems Thinking

Everyone learns throughout life, yet not everyone is aware of it. Many do not realize what they gain from learning, what they should learn specifically, or what it means to take on the role of a student. Nonetheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills assist individuals in understanding the world: dealing with uncertainties, solving problems, and achieving goals. The purpose of understanding is one of the universal answers to "why should we learn?"

David Deutsch's Principle of Optimism states that problems will always exist, and only a lack of knowledge prevents a person from dealing with them at any given moment. If we know how to solve certain problems, they are no longer problems for us. We simply need to apply the knowledge we have—take action and do it.

Knowledge—those relevant today and not outdated or pseudoscientific—is primarily acquired from theories (disciplines). However, practical application is also essential: "theory without practice is dead, and practice without theory is blind." When we apply this knowledge in life and use certain tools to do so, we demonstrate mastery. Through mastery, something changes (or emerges) in the physical world.

For instance, a person studies the discipline of "Accounting" and then, using tools like "1C" or SAP, demonstrates their accounting mastery: creating a work artifact—a balance sheet. Similarly, one can study "Woodworking" and then, with carpentry tools, create a work artifact—a chair. The key is that some physical objects have appeared in the world, and their appearance changes the world.

The first answer to "What should we learn?" is this: it's essential to learn top-notch theories and master the tools associated with these disciplines to produce superior work artifacts. Ideally, one would discover their calling—what nature has gifted them. To do this, it's necessary to test one's hypotheses, which means studying the relevant theory. For example, if you have a talent for music, knowledge of musical notation is indispensable. If you work well with people, systemic management can be beneficial to becoming a leader. Without a solid theory, rapid and consistent progress, as well as achieving high and stable results, is impossible.

To study any theory, it is crucial to understand that at a meta-level, it can be broken down into concepts, principles (theorems, laws, models), roles, work artifacts, procedures (checklists) for creating work artifacts, explanations (proofs, clarifications, justifications). In the discipline of "Accounting," for example, the following can be identified: concepts—assets, liabilities, accountant, etc.; roles—accountant, tax specialist; principle—double entry; work artifacts—balance sheets, profit and loss statements, etc.

In the next answer to the question "What should we learn?" the division of knowledge (theory, discipline) into two categories can help:

1. **Thinking Mastery:** It helps tackle new and previously unknown problems.
2. **Applied Mastery:** It addresses a specific class of problems (professional skills such as those of a driver, swimmer, marketer, architect, or manager).

Modern individuals must continually develop thinking mastery (intellect) and, when necessary, cultivate specific applied mastery (professional skills and abilities). This means each person is both an intellectual and a professional, continuously addressing new problems intellectually and solving known problem sets professionally. 

Even when a child learns to walk, intellect is engaged, and once the skill is mastered, applied mastery emerges. The development of basic applied mastery engages intellect, initially based on innate reflexes and genes provided by nature. As individuals encounter new situations, their intellect continuously evolves. For example, a child goes to the store for the first time, attends school in another city, or resolves new work challenges. Typically, individuals develop their intellect unconsciously.

Formal thinking techniques and approaches would be helpful when we first create a car or an IT program, but nature hasn’t endowed us with them. These techniques can be learned, and today, the best thinking techniques are collected in systems thinking.

Applied disciplines (knowledge) work with specific physical systems that can be identified at different levels or scales. For example, a therapist works with the whole organism, while a neurobiologist operates at the cellular level. Professionalism means promptly and effectively addressing a known class of tasks. For example, a professional swimmer can traverse a certain distance, and a professional manager knows how to run an enterprise. To become a professional, one needs to learn a specific applied method. A swimmer learns the freestyle stroke, and a manager learns project management.

Since learning is a lifelong journey, conscious learning is of utmost importance. Therefore, it is crucial for everyone to understand, at a fundamental level, the importance of understanding, the structure of any theory, the ability to choose the best knowledge, and the ability to learn it quickly.
