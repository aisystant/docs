# Why and What to Learn in the Modern World

Everyone learns throughout their life, but not everyone realizes it. Not everyone understands what they gain from learning, what exactly they should learn, or what it means to be a student [ ^1 ]. Nonetheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills help a person understand the world, cope with uncertainties, solve problems, and achieve goals [ ^2 ]. The purpose of knowledge acquisition is one of the general answers to the question, "Why learn?"

David Deutsch's principle of optimism [ ^3 ] suggests that problems will always exist, and it is only a lack of knowledge that prevents a person from solving them at any given moment. Once we know how to tackle specific tasks, they are no longer problems for us. It's simply a matter of applying the knowledge we have—just take action and do it.

We acquire knowledge [ ^4 ] primarily from theories (disciplines) [ ^5 ]. When we apply this knowledge in life (and use certain tools to do so), we demonstrate mastery. Mastery leads to changes in the physical world, bringing new things into existence.

For example, a person studies the discipline of "Accounting," and then, using a tool like "1C" or SAP, they demonstrate the mastery of an accountant: creating a work artifact—an accounting balance sheet. Similarly, one can study "Carpentry" and use carpentry tools to create a work artifact—a chair. The key point is that some physical objects come into existence, changing the world.

The first answer to the question "What to learn?" is: learn the best theories and master the tools associated with these disciplines to create the best work artifacts. It's fantastic if you manage to find your purpose, discovering what nature has endowed you with. To do this, you need to test your hypotheses, which means studying the relevant theory. For instance, if you have a talent for music, you cannot do without music theory [ ^6 ], and if you are good with people, systems management can help you become a leader. Without a good theory, it's impossible to progress quickly and consistently, achieving high and stable results.

To study any theory, it is essential to understand what can be highlighted at the meta-level: concepts (terms, terminology), principles (theorems, laws, models), roles, work artifacts, procedures (checklists) for creating work artifacts, explanations (proofs, clarifications, justifications). For example, in the discipline of "Accounting," there are concepts like assets, liabilities, accountant, etc.; roles like accountant, tax specialist; the principle of double-entry bookkeeping; work artifacts like balance sheets, profit and loss statements, etc.

In the next answer to the question "What to learn?" the division of knowledge (theories, disciplines) into the following two categories will help develop:

1. Thinking mastery—it helps deal with new and previously unknown problems.
2. Applied mastery—it solves an already defined class of tasks [ ^7 ].

For modern individuals, it is important to continuously develop thinking mastery (intellect) and, when necessary, to develop specific applied mastery (professional skills and competencies) [ ^8 ]. This means that each person is simultaneously an intellectual and a professional, as they constantly have to address new problems using their intellect and solve certain known classes of tasks as a professional [ ^9 ] in a specific field.

Even when a child learns to walk, they utilize their intellect, and when they master this skill, they gain applied mastery [ ^10 ]. In developing the simplest forms of applied mastery, intellect, which is initially based on innate reflexes and genes, comes into play. It continuously evolves as a person faces something new. For example, a child goes to a store for the first time, moves to another city for education after school, or solves new work problems. Typically, people develop their intellect unconsciously.

Formal thinking techniques and approaches could be advantageous when creating a car or IT program for the first time [ ^11 ]. These techniques can be learned. Today, the best thinking techniques are compiled in systems thinking.

Applied disciplines (knowledge) deal with specific physical systems that can be identified at different levels or scales. For example, a therapist works with the whole body, while a neurobiologist operates at the cellular level. Professionalism is about quickly and effectively solving a known class of tasks. For instance, a professional swimmer can swim a certain distance, and a professional manager knows how to manage an enterprise. To become a professional, you need to learn a specific applied method. A swimmer learns the freestyle stroke, while a manager learns project management. Professionals earn good money and recognition, not so much for their intellect but for their professionalism. However, intellect helps one become a professional faster. It is particularly vital when creating complex systems or when frequent retraining is required, as well as when working in large teams.

Since we learn throughout our lives, conscious learning is of utmost importance. That's why everyone needs to fundamentally understand the value of knowledge acquisition, the structure of any theory, the ability to select the best knowledge, and learn it quickly.

[ ^1 ]: Answer to the question "How to learn?" is provided in the course "Practices of Self-Development."

[ ^2 ]: Including finding the meaning of life. Post "What's Important in Life" at the Aisystant: <https://systemsworld.club/t/chto-v-zhizni-glavnoe/5034>.

[ ^4 ]: Those relevant today, not outdated or unscientific.

[ ^5 ]: Of course, practice is indispensable: "theory without practice is dead, and practice without theory is blind."

[ ^6 ]: Sure, one can become a professional through practice, practice, and more practice, but without theory, it's a long road (and without theory, the likelihood of success is much lower). It's ideal to supplement talent with the best theories known to humanity, i.e., to become cultured.

[ ^7 ]: For example, this is the professional mastery of a driver, swimmer, marketer, architect, or manager.

[ ^8 ]: How to increase your value in the job market can be found in the Aisystant post: <https://systemsworld.club/t/kak-povyshat-svoyu-czennost-na-rynke-truda-ili-pro-karla-rante-i-moniku-prodakt-menedzhera/4473>.

[ ^9 ]: A professional works almost automatically, possessing unconscious competence. For example, you automatically clean your apartment or drive a car. However, when you were learning a new skill, you mainly used your intellect. Over time, the intellect is engaged less, and more actions are performed automatically. This is related to the minimization of energy and attention costs, which are limited.

[ ^10 ]: That is, intellect also helps to master new applied mastery faster. When a new problem arises, the intellect finds a solution based on existing experience and engages current applied mastery. Alternatively, the intellect determines that new mastery is necessary and aids in acquiring it faster.

[ ^11 ]: But nature has not endowed us with them.
