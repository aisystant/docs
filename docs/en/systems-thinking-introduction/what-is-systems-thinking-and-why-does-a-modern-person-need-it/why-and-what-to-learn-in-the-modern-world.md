# Why and What to Learn in the Modern World

Every person learns throughout their life, although not everyone realizes this. Not everyone understands what they gain from learning, what specifically they should learn, and what it means to take on the role of a student [ ^1 ]. Nevertheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills help individuals understand the world, manage uncertainties, solve problems, and achieve goals [ ^2 ]. The pursuit of knowledge is one of the overarching reasons for asking "why learn?"

David Deutsch's principle of optimism [ ^3 ] suggests that problems will always exist, and it is the lack of knowledge that prevents individuals from addressing them at any given moment. After all, if we know how to solve certain problems, they are no longer issues for us. We simply need to apply the knowledge we have—meaning, we need to take action.

Knowledge [ ^4 ] is primarily acquired from theories (disciplines) [ ^5 ], and when we apply this knowledge in real life (and use certain tools to do so), we demonstrate mastery. Through mastery, something changes or appears in the physical world.

For example, a person studies the discipline of "Accounting" and then uses the technology [ ^6 ] "1C" or SAP to demonstrate their accounting expertise: creating a work artifact [ ^7 ]—a balance sheet. Similarly, one can study "Carpentry" and then use carpentry tools to create a work artifact—a "chair." The key is that physical objects have emerged in the world, and their presence changes the world.

The first answer to "What should I learn?" is: learn the best theories and master the tools concerning those disciplines to produce superior work artifacts. It is beneficial if you discover your calling, that is, the talents bestowed upon you by nature. To do this, you need to test your hypotheses, which means studying the corresponding theory. For instance, if you have a talent for music, you cannot do without music notation [ ^8 ]; and if you get along well with people, systems management will benefit you in becoming a leader. Without a solid theory, it is impossible to progress rapidly and consistently, achieving high and stable results.

To study any theory, it is necessary to understand that on a meta-level it comprises: concepts (terms), principles (theorems, laws, models), roles, work artifacts, procedures (checklists) for creating work artifacts, explanations (proofs, clarifications, justifications). For example, in the discipline of "Accounting," the following can be noted: concepts—asset, liability, accountant, etc.; roles—accountant, tax specialist; principle—double-entry bookkeeping; work artifacts—balance sheet, income statement, and so on.

In the next response to "What should I learn?" dividing knowledge (theory, discipline) into two categories helps to develop:

1. thinking mastery—it helps to handle new and previously unknown problems;
2. applied mastery—it solves an already defined class of problems [ ^9 ].

It's crucial for modern individuals to continually develop their thinking mastery (intellect) and, as needed, to enhance specific applied mastery (professional skills and abilities) [ ^10 ]. In this sense, every person is simultaneously an intellectual and a professional because they constantly have to address new problems using their intellect and solve a defined known class of problems as a professional [ ^11 ] in a certain area.

Even when a child learns to walk, their intellect is engaged, and once they master the skill, they gain applied mastery [ ^12 ]. Developing the simplest applied mastery involves the intellect, initially based on innate reflexes and genes. It continues to develop as the individual encounters new experiences. For example, a child visits a store for the first time, leaves to study in another city after school, or finds solutions to new work problems. Generally, people develop their intellect unconsciously.

Formal thinking techniques and approaches would have been helpful when creating a car or an IT program for the first time [ ^13 ]. These techniques can be learned. Currently, the best thinking techniques are compiled in systems thinking.

Applied disciplines (knowledge) work with specific physical systems that can be delineated at different levels or scales. For example, a therapist works with the whole organism, while a neurobiologist works at the cellular level. Professionalism is the ability to solve a known class of problems quickly and efficiently. For example, a professional swimmer can swim a certain distance, and a professional manager knows how to run an enterprise. To become a professional, one must learn a specific applied method. A swimmer learns the method of freestyle, while a manager learns project management. Professionals are paid for professionalism (rather than solely for intellect), earning good money and recognition. However, intellect helps in becoming a professional faster. It is especially important when creating complex systems or when frequent retraining is necessary, or when working in large teams.

Since we learn throughout our lives, conscious learning is crucial for us. Therefore, everyone should fundamentally understand the importance of acquiring knowledge, the structure of any theory, the ability to choose the best knowledge, and the ability to learn it swiftly.

[ ^1 ]: The answer to "How to learn?" is provided in the course "Practices of Self-Development."  
[ ^2 ]: Including finding the meaning of life. Post "What is Important in Life" in the Aisystant club: <https://systemsworld.club/t/chto-v-zhizni-glavnoe/5034>.

[ ^4 ]: Those relevant today, not outdated or unscientific.  
[ ^5 ]: Of course, practice is essential: "theory without practice is dead, practice without theory is blind."  
[ ^6 ]: From now on, we will predominantly use the word "tool," with "technology" remaining as a synonym.  
[ ^7 ]: A work artifact is the physical (touchable) result of your work. It can be represented in various ways, including writing texts, creating diagrams, developing databases, or physical objects (like a chair). Work artifacts help you study and apply practices with theory and track your progress and work results. The list of work artifacts and their usage is usually described in the corresponding material or homework within a specific course or practice.  
[ ^8 ]: Of course, one can become a professional through practice, practice, and practice again, but without theory, it is a much longer path (and without theory, the likelihood of success is much lower). Talent should preferably be supported by the best theories known to humanity, i.e., it should be cultured.  
[ ^9 ]: For example, the professional mastery of a driver, a swimmer, a marketer, an architect, or a manager.  
[ ^10 ]: How to increase your value in the job market is discussed in a club post: <https://systemsworld.club/t/kak-povyshat-svoyu-czennost-na-rynka-truda-ili-pro-karla-rante-i-moniku-prodakt-menedzhera/4473>.  
[ ^11 ]: A professional works almost automatically, meaning they have unconscious competence. For example, you automatically clean the apartment or drive a car. However, when you were learning a new mastery, your intellect was predominantly involved. Over time, intellect engages less, and more actions are performed automatically. This is related to minimizing energy and attention, which are limited.  
[ ^12 ]: That is, intellect also assists in quickly acquiring new applied mastery. When a new problem arises, intellect finds a solution based on existing experience and using current applied mastery. Or, intellect determines that new mastery is necessary and aids in quickly acquiring it.  
[ ^13 ]: But nature did not equip us with them.
