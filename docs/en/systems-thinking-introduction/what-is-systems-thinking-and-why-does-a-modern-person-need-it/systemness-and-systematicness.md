# Systemness and Systematicness

Most people operate with a "colloquial" understanding of the concepts of "system" and "systems thinking." They interpret 'the use of a systems approach or systems thinking' as mere personal organization, diligence, and the desire to anticipate every possible detail. That is misguided!

Using a systems approach is often confused with systematicity—and systematically poor or incorrect thinking leads to disastrous results. Although many dictionaries define the use of a systems approach and systematicity as synonyms, we will differentiate between these concepts. Systematicity, regularity, and discipline mean that a person does something constantly, on schedule. In contrast, using a systems approach means that a person can "slice" the world into different systems with their attention and work with these systems and the various interests of people. It is a distinct mental (systems) technique that requires systematic training.

The use of a systems approach determines "what to do," while systematicity means doing it regularly, constantly, and rhythmically. One concept does not replace the other. It is necessary to be both systems-oriented and systematic. Our course discusses systems approaches, while systematicity is covered in the "Practices of Self-Development" course.

It's well-known that in the world, everything is interconnected; a systems approach is not just about ensuring no detail is overlooked. It's necessary to highlight what's important from the general background and, conversely, integrate something important into the overall context. Systems thinking guides the focus of a specialist or team during project implementation. Objects of focus are designated with specific concepts. Using these concepts, we focus our attention on both the important elements and contexts. Therefore, our course:

* Introduces several dozen such systems concepts;
* Teaches thinking techniques and relevant systems modeling that connect these concepts;
* Develops the skill of locating these concepts in work and personal projects.

Here are two systems thinking techniques that will be covered in the course.

The first technique draws attention to the fact that any activity can be viewed through three interconnected areas. They must answer the following questions:

1. Why, for whom, and how will behavior change if something new is offered?
2. What is this new thing from a product (system) standpoint, what are its characteristics, how is it structured, and from what is it made?
3. Who and how will create the system, including which methods and resources will be used?

The second technique concerns the connection between analysis and synthesis, or identifying the functions and structures of a system. In corporate culture, much is said about analysis—and rightly so. However, one must not forget that analytical activity is only a part; synthesis is also necessary. Analysis involves breaking down into parts, while synthesis is about assembling and obtaining a work artifact (system). Systems thinking employs both functional analysis, which divides a system into functional parts, and modular synthesis, which assembles a whole system from structural components. It's the work artifact or physical structure that introduces something new and changes behavior (changes the world), and it's precisely what people pay for.

Considering the above, you need to prepare for the fact that many of your current beliefs will conflict with the methodology of systems thinking. If you work with these discrepancies using thinking through writing (modeling), by the end of the course, your worldview will have significantly evolved.
