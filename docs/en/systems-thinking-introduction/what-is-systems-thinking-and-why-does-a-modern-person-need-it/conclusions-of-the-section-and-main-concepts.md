# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

Ordinary tasks are tackled with applied mastery, but when the complexity of issues and tasks skyrockets, intellect or thinking mastery comes into play.

Modern trends show that people increasingly encounter new problems and complex tasks, requiring consideration of a multitude of different interests. Therefore, for intellect that demonstrates systems thinking, the following objectives can be formulated:

* Integrating different worldviews;
* Universally solving complex problems across various fields;
* Constantly improving the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory that can integrate different worldviews. For this purpose, there exists an intellect stack comprised of 16 transdisciplines, and an intellect equipped with this stack yields the function of systems thinking. This enables systems-oriented individuals to connect different stakeholders' interests in a coherent manner.

Key concepts: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classic properties of a system: integrity (of a system), emergent properties, nestedness; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, self-development practices, applied practices; systematicity, the use of a systems approach or systems thinking; applied mastery, thinking mastery, intellect, life mastery.
