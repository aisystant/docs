# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

Ordinary tasks are addressed using applied skills, but when the complexity of problems and challenges is overwhelming, intelligence or thinking mastery comes into play.

Modern trends indicate that individuals increasingly face new problems and complex challenges that require considering a variety of interests. Therefore, the intelligence that demonstrates a systems-oriented approach can be aligned with the following aspirations:

* Integrating different worldviews;
* Universality in solving complex problems across various fields;
* Continuing to improve the speed and quality of addressing new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory that can integrate different worldviews. For this purpose, there exists an intellect stack from 16 transdisciplines, and intelligence equipped with this intellect stack yields the function of systems thinking. This enables systems-oriented individuals to coherently connect various stakeholders' interests.

**Main Concepts**: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classical properties of a system: integrity, emergence, nestedness; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, practices of self-development, applied practices; systematicity, using a systems approach; applied skills, thinking mastery, intelligence, life skills.
