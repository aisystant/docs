# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

Ordinary tasks are solved using applied mastery, but when the complexity of problems and tasks reaches its peak, intellect or thinking mastery comes into play.

Current trends indicate that people increasingly encounter new problems and complex tasks, which require considering a multitude of different interests in their resolution. Therefore, the following expectations can be formulated for intelligence that exhibits systems thinking:

* interconnection between different worldviews;
* versatility in solving complex problems across various fields of activity;
* continuous improvement in the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory capable of linking different worldviews together. This is facilitated by an intellect stack comprising 16 transdisciplines, and the intelligence that embeds this intellect stack produces the function of systems thinking. This allows systems-oriented individuals to harmoniously integrate various interests of stakeholders.

Key concepts: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classic properties of a system: integrity (of a system), emergence, nestedness; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, self-development practices, applied practices; systematicity, the use of a systems approach or systems thinking; applied mastery, thinking mastery, intellect, life mastery.
