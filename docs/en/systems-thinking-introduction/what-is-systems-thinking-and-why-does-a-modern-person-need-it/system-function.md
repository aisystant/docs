# System Function

### Separation of the Physical World and Mental Space

Distinguishing between a system and its function becomes clearer when we separate the physical world from mental space. For example, a car is a physical object that exists in the real world. It is the embodiment of a system or a tangible physical object. Like any system, a car has a function—in this case, mobility. Mobility, just like any other system function, is abstract and cannot be touched. However, we can observe mobility; more accurately, we see the car in motion.

Functions (or behaviors, or actions) are assigned by people; things do not choose their functions themselves. A hammer, for instance, cannot designate its function as nail driving. An interested party could take a microscope and designate (call) it a "hammer," assigning it the function of driving nails. In this case, the hammer is merely a role assigned to the microscope—or even a stone. Thus, the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role is driving nails.

People value not so much the thing itself (the material object) but its function. This is what interested parties appreciate, though laypeople rarely share their views. A **system skill** involves distinct examination and discussion of a function needed by someone and the structure (physical object) best suited to perform that function.

This thinking technique of separating a system from its function can be applied to thinking itself. We could say that thinking is a function of the intellect. Here, intellect serves as the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
