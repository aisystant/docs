# Function of a System

Separating the physical world from the mental space helps us understand the distinction between a system and its function. For instance, a car is a physical object that exists in the real world. It is the embodiment of a system or a physical object that can be touched. Like any system, a car has a function, and in this case, its function is movement. Movement, like any function of a system, is abstract and cannot be touched. However, we can see movement, or rather, we see the car moving.

Functions (or behaviors, or actions) are assigned by people; objects do not choose functions for themselves. A hammer cannot assign itself the function of driving nails. An interested party might take a microscope and assign (name) it a "hammer," thus attributing to it the function of driving nails. The hammer would then be nothing more than a role for the microscopeâ€”or a stone. In this case, the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role is driving nails.

People need not so much the object itself (the material object) but its function. That is what interested parties value, though the layperson rarely shares their views. A system skill involves separately considering and discussing the function that is needed by someone and the design (physical object) that is best suited to perform that function.

The mental approach of separating a system and its function can also be applied to thinking itself. We can say that thinking is a function of intelligence. In this context, intelligence is the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
