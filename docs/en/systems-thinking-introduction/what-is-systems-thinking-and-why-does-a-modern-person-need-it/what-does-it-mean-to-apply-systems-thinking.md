# What Does It Mean to "Apply Systems Thinking"?

Applying systems thinking means skillfully operating with the concepts of the transdisciplines of the intellect stack in your activities. Possessing the conceptual minimum implies not just knowing each concept, but also being able to connect them together and apply them to your projects. In this course, you learn the concepts of systems thinking, linking them not only with each other but also with entrepreneurship, engineering, and management concepts.

When someone says they will apply a systems approach, it means they will use the conceptual minimum of systems thinking in their activities. If a person does not possess these concepts, they may be logical, systematic, professional, and whatever else, but not systems-oriented.

A professional with an extensive track record does not necessarily possess systems thinking, although they may solve any complex tasks in their field of interest. We will consider as a system constructor someone who has consciously [^1] studied and applies the concepts of modern systems methodology in both work and personal projects [^2].

Moreover, a system constructor must have developed a "type classifier/cognitive type machine" â€” the ability to track the types of concepts being applied. For example, an ordinary adult can spot a mismatch in types in the following list: "I visited New York, London, and China." Here, the type "city" is used alongside the type "country," which is incorrect from a systems thinking perspective and it's better not to confuse types. Similarly, a system constructor spots discrepancies in sentences like: "The meeting was attended by John Doe, Andrew Smith, and the accountant of the contractor" or "I am performing the roles of a marketer, financier, and department head." In these cases, the type "executor/performer (agent)" is used alongside the type "role," and in the second example, the type "role" is mixed with the type "position," which is incorrect and it's better not to mix types in work activities [^3].

The type classifier [^4] enables the fluent application of systems thinking, without getting confused in descriptions (modeling) and communication in complex projects. That is, you can't mix types of systems concepts such as system, role, position, process, etc. Setting up the work of the type classifier occurs in the "Rational Work" course, although for some students, it was established back in college and quickly adapts to a new conceptual framework.

[^1]: This means attention is focused on the conceptual minimum as well as finding these concepts in work projects.
[^2]: There's no 100% guarantee that all these projects will be successful. However, all other things being equal, the chance of success increases with systems thinking.
[^3]: If these examples are unclear to you, consider taking the "Rational Work" course.
[^4]: As an ontological mastery that integrates into the brain and body. The error signal in types is noticed at the level of sensations in the body, hence the term ontological jitter. In addition to jitter, it's recommended to pay attention to other bodily sensations in intellectual activities, such as cognitive resonance and creative click.
