# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to each, write down the concepts with which they are most strongly connected in your understanding. These additional concepts may come from your current worldviews and are not limited to the main concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with your classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For example, you can try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts together, or explain their importance.

In your modeling workspace, locate the corresponding assignment by its number and complete all its points.
