# Perform Modeling: 1.1. Concepts

List five or more of the most memorable concepts from this section, and note the concepts with which they are most strongly connected for you. Other concepts may stem from your current worldviews, so you don't need to limit yourself to just the main concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with fellow students, colleagues, or close acquaintances. For instance, you can try to explain these concepts in simple terms, give examples from your own experience, connect different concepts, or explain their importance.

Locate the corresponding task by its number in your modeling workspace and complete all its points.
