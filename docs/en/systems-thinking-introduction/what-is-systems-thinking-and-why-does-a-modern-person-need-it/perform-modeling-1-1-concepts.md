# Perform Modeling: 1.1. Concepts

List the five or more concepts from this section that you remember the most, and next to them, note the concepts they are most connected with for you. These other concepts can be from your current worldview, so you don't need to limit yourself to only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with your peers, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, try explaining these concepts in simple language, providing examples from your experience, connecting different concepts with each other, or explaining their importance.

Find the corresponding task by number in your modeling workspace and complete all its points.
