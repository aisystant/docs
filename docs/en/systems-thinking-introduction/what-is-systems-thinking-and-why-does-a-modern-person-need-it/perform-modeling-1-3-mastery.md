# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.3. Mastery

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first row of the table. If needed, revisit the theoretical material and use the AI bot Aisystant as necessary. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If you lack the knowledge to find the appropriate words and designations (names), you can use ChatGPT or Google.

Provide examples of your personal mastery in work and leisure.

Locate the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
