# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.7. Form and Content

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material and utilize the AI-bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your experience is not broad enough to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, record reflections or questions that you can later ask in support chats.

In the modeling workspace, find the corresponding task by number and complete all its points.
