# Perform Modeling: 1.7. Form and Content

**Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material and use the AI-bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the necessary words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance.**

**Provide examples from work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further refinement. For instance, in the "Notes" column, record reflections or questions that can later be asked in support chats.**

**In the modeling workspace, find the corresponding task by its number and complete all its points.**
