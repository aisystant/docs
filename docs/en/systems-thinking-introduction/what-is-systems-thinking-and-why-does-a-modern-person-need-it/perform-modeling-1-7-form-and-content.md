# Perform Modeling: 1.7. Form and Content

Review the examples in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material, and feel free to use the AI bot, Aisystant. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If you lack the knowledge to choose the appropriate words and designations (names), consider using ChatGPT or Google for assistance.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. As needed, compile notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, record reflections or questions that can later be asked in support chats.

Locate the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all of its sections.
