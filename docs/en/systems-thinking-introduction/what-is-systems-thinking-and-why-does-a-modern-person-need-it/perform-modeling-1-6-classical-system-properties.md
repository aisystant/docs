title: 'Perform Modeling: 1.6. Classical System Properties'
---

### Familiarize Yourself with the Examples in the First Rows of the Table

If necessary, repeat the theoretical material. Note that the column "System" contains examples of ideal objects. Recall the difference between the classical systems approach and Systems Approach 2.0, particularly what objective and subjective consideration of a system means.

### Describe the Properties of the Systems Listed in the Table

You can create your own examples if needed. Highlight the classical properties of systems from work and personal projects.

### Form Notes for Further Elaboration as Needed

For example, under the "Notes" column, write a reflection or a substantive question that you can later ask in support chats.

### Find the Corresponding Task by Number in the Modeling Workspace

Complete all its points.
