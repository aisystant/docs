# Perform Modeling: 1.6. Classic Properties of a System

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material. Note that the "System" column provides examples of ideal objects. Recall what differentiates the classic systems approach from systems approach 2.0, particularly what objective and subjective consideration of a system means.

Describe the properties of the systems listed in the table. You may also create your own examples. Highlight the classic properties of systems from both work and personal projects.

Formulate notes for further development as needed. For instance, in the "Notes" column, record any reflections or questions that might later be asked in support chats.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
