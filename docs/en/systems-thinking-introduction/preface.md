# Preface

The course "Introduction to Systems Thinking" will assist you in taking the first step into the fascinating realm of systems thinking. Throughout the course, you will become acquainted with the foundational concepts of systems thinking and start applying them to both your professional and personal projects.

You have the option to undertake the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course independently or as part of a group class with an instructor. If you enroll with an instructor, you will receive feedback on all your inquiries and homework assignments. The instructor will highlight potential pitfalls, help you navigate challenging concepts, and accelerate your understanding of this intricate systems thinking.

The course consists of 7 sections [ ^1 ] and 7 homework assignments (henceforth referred to as HA) which should be completed based on personal life examples and work projects. Each HA requires practicing thinking through writing [ ^2 ], and results should be published as an outline (post) in the AISYSTANT club. In your outline, use notes and drafts that you will compose during the course.

When completing homework, it is highly recommended to engage in modeling using the appropriate tables. Such work serves as a systems thinking exercise. The establishment of systems thinking occurs through:

* Studying the theory (concepts, principles, thinking techniques) presented in the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course;
* Modeling based on examples provided in the homework;
* Modeling on several of your actual projects, which you will predominantly carry out within the second semester.

Every homework assignment contains several modeling exercises in the form of template tables that need to be filled based on the given examples. The headings of the template tables are meta-meta models ("from the textbook") for describing a particular project activity, while the content of the completed tables is usually meta-models or models (from a specific applied subject area). By filling out the template tables, you are engaging in modeling.

Nearly all template tables are divided into the following sections:

* An example of a table being filled out, which you must study carefully, paying attention to the connection between systems thinking terms in the table heading and real-life examples;
* An assignment to fill in the missing cells according to the example;
* An assignment for modeling a work project;
* An assignment for modeling a personal life project (such as systems for the body, teeth, abs, workspace, etc.).

Within the framework of the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course with an instructor, you will study the corresponding online course, model simple personal and work projects in tables, and receive feedback from the instructor. At the end of the course, it is recommended to write a final systems essay.

Systems thinking is no simpler than mathematical analysis. However, even an average school student can handle it through certain self-development practices. Therefore, each student will need to carry out the following independent work as part of the course:

* Organize systematic, slow reading of each section of the online course and additional literature over a week (ideally every day, avoiding reading everything in one day) and compose educational notes [ ^3 ];
* Consistently implement the practice of thinking through writing while completing HA and write 8 outlines (one for each of the seven sections and a final outline about the course completion);
* Adjust your current schedule, allocating 10–15 hours per week over 2 months for studying the course [ ^4 ], as well as maintaining a daily routine [ ^5 ];
* Continuously monitor the time invested in learning according to the schedule and the designated time slots for each day of the week.

Pay attention to your personal organization: systematically completing HA, planning, and accounting time for learning. It's crucial to focus on the total invested time to get accustomed to complex learning and see initial positive results in the form of completed plans for time investment in the course [ ^6 ]. Only after this will you gain a deeper understanding of the essence of the systems methodology.

During the course, it will be beneficial to broaden your activity horizon, namely, to learn the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts in very different areas of activity. You may have a good activity horizon in anatomy (system "organism"), but you might be less familiar with the terms used in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. Systems thinking is not deskwork; you will need to engage with diverse people! Don’t postpone it for later; start today. For instance, write, call, or talk over a cup of coffee with colleagues or friends. Additionally, utilize our AI bot Aisystant, ChatGPT, and Google.

I hope that your first step into systems thinking will be successful and that you will discover a methodology that literally changes worldviews and life.

To complete your homework, use your personal workspace for modeling:

[ ^1 ]: It is strongly recommended to arm yourself with a pen or take notes on a computer while reading. It is proven that consuming information while simultaneously recording emerging ideas and questions makes learning much more effective.
[ ^2 ]: Thinking through writing is the main method for mastering complex methodology: if you're not writing, chances are you're not learning. If you complete HA in writing, it means you're engaging and developing your intellect.
[ ^3 ]: On the Aisystant platform, educational notes are automatically sent to the club, where they can be gathered into drafts and later used to write a post outline, which is also published in the club.
[ ^4 ]: If you prefer a comfortable and unhurried pace: cover one section per week. If you have more time, you can complete the course faster. However, it’s recommended to spend at least a month to thoughtfully complete all HA.
[ ^5 ]: If you don’t change your schedule and, for example, don’t get enough rest and sleep or lead a healthy lifestyle, you might lack the energy for challenging intellectual work.
[ ^6 ]: Substantive results in work projects and life, in general, will appear later. And you will need to hold out until you receive them. Focusing on time investment will aid in achieving results.
