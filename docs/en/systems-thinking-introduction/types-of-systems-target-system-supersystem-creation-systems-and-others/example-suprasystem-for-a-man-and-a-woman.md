title: 'Example: Suprasystem for a Man and a Woman'
---

Let's consider a common example involving agents like a man and a woman. What supersystems might exist with their participation in specific roles? Yes, they interact in some way, possessing functionality within the supersystem. What is it?

I hope you quickly realized that the supersystem here could be a family, where the woman and man exist in each other’s systems environment, fulfilling the roles of wife and husband. In other words, the family consists not of a woman and a man, but of a husband and wife.

The puzzle of naming the supersystem can be solved by identifying a missing, unnamed, or unrecognized system within the system breakdown. This is a typical situation: supersystems are often poorly discernible, sometimes lacking established names^[Often in culture, there are no established names for some systems, unlike the concept of "family." In your work projects, you will frequently need to introduce new system names. Remember, the name should reflect the system’s primary function.].

These "missing" systems need to be identified, meaning their roles or functions must be described, and they must be named according to their role. Sometimes it will be necessary to choose the most precise words. For example, for a vehicle with a driver and passenger, identifying the supersystem has been challenging without a good alternative. Once you find an appropriate name for a system, many aspects become clearer and simpler. Learn to name systems correctly and to work with semantics^[Semantics is one of the 16 transdisciplines of the intellect stack.].
