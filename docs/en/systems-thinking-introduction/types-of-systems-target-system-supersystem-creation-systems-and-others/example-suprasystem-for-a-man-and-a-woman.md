# Example: Supersystem for Men and Women

Let's consider an everyday example with agents in the form of a man and a woman. What supersystems might exist that include them in specific roles? Indeed, they interact, and they have functionality within the supersystem. What is it?

I hope you quickly realized that the supersystem here could be a family, and the woman and man are within each other's systems environment, playing the roles of husband and wife. That is, a family comprises not just a woman and a man, but a husband and wife.

The puzzle of naming the supersystem can be solved by identifying a missing, unnamed, or undiscovered system within the system breakdowns. This is a typical situation: supersystems are often poorly distinguishable, and sometimes they lack established names [ ^1 ].

These "missing" systems must be identified, meaning describing their roles or functions and naming them according to their role. Sometimes, you'll need to choose the most precise words. For instance, for a vehicle with a driver and passenger, there is a need to identify the supersystem, but a suitable option hasn't been found yet. Once you find an appropriate name for a system, everything becomes clearer and simpler. Learn to name systems correctly and work with semantics [ ^2 ].

[ ^1 ]: Often, there are no established names for certain systems in culture, unlike the concept of 'family.' In your work projects, you will frequently need to introduce new system names. Keep in mind that the name should reflect the main function of the system.
