# Creation Systems

Any activity becomes much more productive when you understand its purpose. From a systems approach perspective, we can say that the goal of any activity is to create a system of interest. Accordingly, creation systems are involved in activities to embody this system of interest in the physical world. Typically, this creative activity is referred to as a project, process, program, etc. Do not confuse the types "project" and "enterprise" (or "extended enterprise"), as the former is an activity, while the latter is a system.

For example, the goal of creation systems' activities might be the system of interest — the Mercedes E-Class vehicle. The factory operations are processes involving certain creation systems. For instance, those that perform assembly.

We call those systems that support all stages of a system's development from conception to disposal "creation systems." In our example with the system of interest "vehicle," factory operations involve designers, component suppliers, assembly lines. However, creation systems also include service stations and car dismantlers, which are not necessarily part of an automotive corporation. It is extremely rare for all creation systems to be part of a single enterprise, which is why we refer to the extended enterprise.

An important note about creation systems is that you cannot call any activity a system of interest. Firstly, activities are not systems (neither systems of interest, nor creators, nor any other types). Secondly, when you observe an activity, it is likely the activity of certain creation systems that are generating a particular system (of interest or ours). It's more precise to first consider the purpose of this activity. Most likely, it is aimed at creating a system. That system, in all likelihood, will be the system of interest, while what you are engaged in — such as factory operations — is merely the activity of some creation systems.

It is also not recommended to call a factory a system of interest. The system of interest is likely the factory’s product. Therefore, you should always find out what the factory produces. An iron factory and a car factory are entirely different enterprises. The system of interest determines what the creation systems should be like. Therefore, first, we need to understand what the enterprise produces, as this will help you better grasp how it should be structured. That is, the kind of factory that needs to be built depends on the factory's product, which will be the system of interest.

Only after this understanding can you move on to another project where the creation system becomes "our system." Often, in project activities, you think about the system of interest “vehicle,” but at the same time, you need to build the factory (hire and organize people) that will produce this vehicle. In such cases, it is necessary to manage attention by distinguishing these two considerations.
