# Three Systems

## Introduction to Systems in Project Activities

In this section, you will learn about the types of systems that need to be identified and with which you will work in any project. Its goal is to introduce you to the system of interest, supersystem, and creation systems using simple examples, as well as to teach you to differentiate between product and service, and function and service.

In the modern systems approach, three main systems are highlighted that help manage focus in complex project activities: the system of interest, the supersystem, and the creator.

In the world, everything is interconnected; that's why we identify systems by focusing our attention on them—just as we distinguish the parts of an elephant. Identifying a subsystem like a tail doesn't mean literally separating it from the body. Individual parts and the system itself are recognized within the overall context by focusing attention. For various projects and even within a single project, the same physical object can be a different system or part of different systems.

At **Aisystant**, courses teach the techniques of this identification and train proficiency in working with each system individually and with all of them together. In this section, we will discuss each of the three main systems.

### The System of Interest

The system of interest is the primary system for which project activities (or the process of creation and development) occur. We consider activities separately^[In this activity, creation systems are involved. You should already distinguish the type "activity" from the type "system".] from their result—the system of interest. When we refer to a constructor changing the world, we imply that they bring into the physical world a certain system of interest. The system of interest is created to solve the problems of a specific group of people—consumers or clients. For instance, for the BMW corporation, the system of interest might be the i8 vehicle.

### The Supersystem

The supersystem is the system that physically includes the system of interest. The system of interest is a part of the supersystem, demonstrating the classic property of nestedness. The system of interest "automobile" may belong to supersystems like "household" or "fleet." The choice of a supersystem should be based on the specific project. Simply naming a supersystem based on the ideal system "automobile" is impossible. Determining and thoroughly studying the supersystem is essential, which is why we will further consider such work artifacts as the usage concept.

The primary methodological approach involves tracing the physical nestedness of the system of interest within the supersystem. This is often where students stumble. The nestedness of systems is easy to see when discussing "iron systems." For example, an engine is part of an automobile. However, systems can be more complex^[For instance, a water safety system.], and it's necessary to train the ability to perceive nestedness relationships and corresponding system levels^[The system of interest and supersystem are two system levels. Creation systems are not included in this system breakdown.].

### Creation Systems

The third type of system is the system-creator or a collection of creation systems. These are systems that participate in the conception, design, production, repair, and disposal of the system of interest. For example, a system-creator could be an organization, while creation systems are its subdivisions. We can also refer to an extended enterprise as a system-creator, which includes multiple organizations.

For example, an extended enterprise creates the system of interest—an automobile—or different creation systems are involved in the automobile's creation. They participate in the process of creating the automobile. Thus, the BMW plant, dealers selling and repairing the automobile, and recyclers—all are creation systems for the "i8 automobile" system of interest. Altogether they form an extended enterprise or system-creator.
