# Three Systems

In this section, you will learn about the types of systems that you need to identify and work with in any project. Its purpose is to introduce you to the system of interest, the supersystem, and the creation systems using simple examples, and to teach you how to distinguish between a product and a service, and a function and a service.

In the modern systems approach, the following three principal systems are distinguished as they aid in managing attention in complex project activities: the system of interest, the supersystem, and the creator.

In the world, everything is interconnected; that's why we identify systems by focusing our attention on them—just as we distinguish the parts of an elephant. When identifying the subsystem tail, we do not literally detach it from the body. Individual parts and the system itself are also identified from the overall context through attention. For different projects and even within a single project, the same physical object can be a different system or part of different systems.

At Aisystant, you learn techniques for this identification, and you train to work fluidly with each system and all of them together. In this section, we will discuss each of the three main systems.

The system of interest is the main system for which the project activity (or process of creation and development) occurs. We consider the activity^[This activity involves creation systems. You should already distinguish the "activity" type from the "system" type.] and its result—the system of interest—separately. When mentioning a constructor changing the world, it implies bringing some system of interest into the physical world. The system of interest is created to solve problems for a specific group of people—consumers, clients. For example, for the “BMW” automotive corporation, the system of interest might be the “i8” car.

A supersystem is a system into which the system of interest physically fits. The system of interest is part of the supersystem. This illustrates the classic property of nestedness. The system of interest “car” might belong to supersystems like “household” or “fleet.” Choosing the supersystem must be based on the specific project. Simply naming a supersystem based on the ideal “car” system will not be possible. The supersystem^[There might be several supersystems. This depends on the team aiming to consider various stakeholders. Each supersystem brings its own external project roles.] must be identified and studied in detail, which is why we will further consider a work artifact known as the usage concept.

The main methodological technique consists of tracking the physical nestedness of the system of interest within the supersystem. Students usually stumble at this point. System nesting is easy to see when discussing "metal systems." For example, an engine is part of a car. However, as we know, systems can be more complex^[For example, a maritime safety system.], so it is necessary to train the ability to see nestedness relationships and corresponding system levels^[The system of interest and the supersystem are two system levels. Creation systems are not part of this system breakdown.].

The third type of systems is the system-creator or the set of creation systems. These systems are involved in the conception, design, production, repair, and disposal of the system of interest. For example, the system-creator is an organization, and the creation systems are its subdivisions. We can also talk about the extended enterprise as a system-creator, which includes many organizations.

For instance, an extended enterprise creates the system of interest—a car—or various creation systems are involved in making the car. They participate in the car manufacturing process. This means that the BMW factory, dealers who sell and repair the car, and disposal companies—all of them are creation systems for the system of interest "i8 car." Together, they form an extended enterprise or a system-creator.
