# Three Systems

In this section, you will learn about the types of systems that need to be identified and worked with in any project. Its goal is to introduce you to the system of interest, the supersystem, and creation systems through simple examples, as well as teach you to distinguish between product and service, function and service.

In the modern systems approach, the following three main systems are highlighted, helping to manage attention in complex project activities: the system of interest, the supersystem, and the creator.

In the world, everything is interconnected; that's why we identify systems by focusing our attention on them—just as we distinguish the parts of an elephant. When isolating the subsystem tail, we don't literally detach it from the body. Both individual parts and the system itself are highlighted from the general context through attention. For different projects, and even within a single project, the same physical object can be a different system or part of different systems.

At Aisystant, students are taught techniques for such identification and are trained to work fluently with each system and all of them together. In this section, we will take a closer look at each of the three main systems.

The system of interest is the main system for which the project activity (or the process of creation and development) occurs. We consider the activity separately [ ^1 ] and its result—the system of interest—separately. When we talk about a constructor changing the world, we imply that they introduce a certain system of interest into the physical world. The system of interest is created to solve problems for a specific group of people—consumers, clients. For example, for the BMW corporation, the system of interest could be the "i8" vehicle.

The supersystem is the system into which the system of interest physically enters. The system of interest is part of the supersystem, showcasing the classic property of nestedness. The system of interest "vehicle" might belong to supersystems like "household" or "fleet." The supersystem needs to be chosen based on the specific project. It's impossible to name the supersystem offhand based solely on the ideal system "vehicle." The supersystem [ ^2 ] needs not only to be defined but also studied in detail; therefore, we will further explore the work artifact known as the usage concept.

The main methodological approach is to trace the physical nestedness of the system of interest within the supersystem. This is usually where students stumble. Nestedness in systems is easy to see when discussing "metal systems." For example, an engine is part of a car. However, as we know, systems can be more complex [ ^3 ], and therefore, it is necessary to train the ability to perceive nestedness and the corresponding system levels [ ^4 ].

The third type of systems is the system-creator or the set of creation systems. These are systems involved in the conception, design, production, repair, and disposal of the system of interest. For example, a system-creator is an organization, and creation systems are its divisions. We can also talk about an extended enterprise as a system-creator, incorporating many organizations.

For instance, an extended enterprise creates the system of interest—an automobile—or different creation systems engage in creating the automobile. They participate in the automobile creation process. Thus, the BMW factory, dealers selling and repairing the vehicle, and recyclers all serve as creation systems for the system of interest "i8" vehicle. Together, they form an extended enterprise or a system-creator.

[ ^1 ]: In this activity, creation systems participate. You should already distinguish "activity" types from "system" types.

[ ^2 ]: There can be several supersystems. This depends on the team that wants to consider various stakeholders. Each supersystem brings its external project roles.

[ ^3 ]: For example, a water safety system.

[ ^4 ]: The system of interest and the supersystem are two system levels. Creation systems do not fall into this system breakdown.
