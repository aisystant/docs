# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 4.1. Concepts

List the five or more concepts from this section that you remember most vividly, and next to each, note the concepts they are most strongly connected to for you. These other concepts can be from your current worldviews, so they donâ€™t have to be exclusively the main concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with fellow students, colleagues, or loved ones. For example, you might try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its requirements.
