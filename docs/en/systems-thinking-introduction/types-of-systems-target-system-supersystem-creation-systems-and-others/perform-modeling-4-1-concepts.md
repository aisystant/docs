# Perform Modeling: 4.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to each one, note the concepts with which they are most closely connected for you. These other concepts may be from your current worldview, so it is not necessary to include only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For example, try to explain these concepts in simple language, provide examples from your experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
