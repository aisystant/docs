Please list five or more key concepts that have made the most impact on you from this section. Next to each, note the concepts with which they are most strongly connected for you. These additional concepts can come from your current worldviews, meaning you don't strictly need to list only the main concepts from this section.

Discuss these concepts with your peers, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, you might try explaining these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding assignment in your modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.
