# Creation Systems

Any activity becomes much more productive when you understand its purpose. From a systems approach perspective, one can say that the aim of any activity is to create a system of interest. Consequently, creation systems will be involved in the activity of bringing this system of interest into the physical world. This creative activity is typically referred to as a project, process, program, etc. It's important not to confuse the types "project" and "enterprise" (or "extended enterprise"), as the first refers to an activity, while the second refers to a system.

For example, the goal of the activity of creation systems would be a system of interest— a Mercedes E-Class vehicle. Factory operations are the processes in which certain creation systems participate, such as those involved in assembly.

Creation systems refer to those systems that support all stages of system development, from conception to disposal. In our example with the system of interest "vehicle," factory operations involve designers, suppliers of components, and assembly lines. However, creation systems also include service stations and scrappers, which may not necessarily be part of the automotive corporation. It is extremely rare for all creation systems to belong to a single enterprise, which is why we talk about an extended enterprise.

A crucial point regarding creation systems is that no activity should be called the system of interest. First, activity is not a system (neither an interest, a creator, nor any other). Second, when you observe an activity, it is most likely the activity of some creation systems that are developing a certain system (an interest or ours). More precisely, you first need to understand why this activity is being conducted. It is likely directed at creating a system. This system is most probably the system of interest, while what you are engaged in—such as factory operations—will be merely the activity of some creation systems.

It is also not advisable to call the factory a system of interest. The system of interest is more likely to be the factory's product. Therefore, it's always important to know what the factory produces. A factory making irons and a car factory are entirely different enterprises. The system of interest determines the nature of the creation systems. This is why we first need to understand what the enterprise produces; this will help to better comprehend how it should be organized. In other words, the type of factory required depends on the factory's product, which will be the system of interest.

After this delineation, you can move on to another project where the creation system becomes "our system." Often, in project activities, you might be thinking about the system of interest "vehicle," but at the same time, you also need to construct a factory (hire and organize people) that will produce this vehicle. In such a case, it's necessary to manage attention, keeping these two considerations separate.
