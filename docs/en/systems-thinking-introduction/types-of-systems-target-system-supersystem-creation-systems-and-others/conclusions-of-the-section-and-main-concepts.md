title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts
---

Firstly, we were introduced to the following types of systems: the system of interest, the supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, surrounding systems, and "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects, so that you can fluently dissect the world into different systems.

Secondly, we discussed the difference between an activity and a system, a product and a service, a service and a function. You might feel that many concepts are excessive, but trust meâ€”they are designed to more precisely describe the various interests which are discussed when creating a successful system.

One of the main techniques in systems thinking is the ability to distinguish and see the connections between the primary types of systems.

**Main Concepts:** system of interest, supersystem, surrounding systems, system-creator, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
