# Conclusions of the Section and Key Concepts

Firstly, we were introduced to the following types of systems: the system of interest, the supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, surrounding systems, and “our system.” You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects to gain fluency in distinguishing the world through different systems.

Secondly, we discussed the differences between activity and system, product and service, service and function. It may seem to you that many concepts are excessive, but trust us—they are devised to more accurately describe the various interests queried when creating a successful system.

One of the main systems techniques is the ability to distinguish and see connections between the primary types of systems.

Key concepts: system of interest, supersystem, systems environment, system-creator, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
