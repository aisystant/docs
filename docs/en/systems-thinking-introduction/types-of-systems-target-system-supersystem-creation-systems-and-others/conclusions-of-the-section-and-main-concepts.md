# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

First, we have been introduced to the following types of systems: system of interest, supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, surrounding systems, and "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects to become fluent in segmenting the world into different systems.

Second, we discussed the difference between activity and system, product and service, service, and function. You might feel that many concepts are superfluous, but trust meâ€”they are designed to more accurately describe the various interests involved in creating a successful system.

One of the main systems-oriented techniques is the ability to distinguish and see connections between the key types of systems.

Key concepts: system of interest, supersystem, systems environment, system-creator, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
