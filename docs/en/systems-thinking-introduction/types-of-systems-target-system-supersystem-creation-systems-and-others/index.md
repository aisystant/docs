# Types of Systems: System of Interest, Supersystem, Creation Systems, and Others

In discussing systems and their various categorization, it's pivotal in understanding the different types of systems that play essential roles in any given context. Here, we elaborate on crucial concepts like the "system of interest," "supersystem," and "creation systems."

### System of Interest

The "system of interest" is the primary focus of our analysis. It is the system around which our study revolves, and optimizing it is often the primary goal. Understanding how this system operates within its environment and interacts with other systems is critical.

### Supersystem

A "supersystem" encompasses the system of interest, incorporating additional layers and systems that interact with or influence it. Recognizing the interactions between the supersystem and the system of interest helps us understand broader dependencies and influences.

### Creation Systems

"Creation systems" refer to those processes and components involved in developing or constructing the system of interest. Gaining insight into creation systems allows one to comprehend the genesis and evolution of the primary system.

## System Breakdown and Structure

In analyzing these systems, it's essential to identify and differentiate various components, such as roles, methods, work artifacts, and functional and modular parts. Recognizing these elements enables effective systems management and development, emphasizing the need for systematicity alongside a systems-oriented approach.

From a systems thinking perspective, [^1] it is incorrect to say that 'a role has an intention' and that 'a person pursues a role interest.' Instead, attention should be paid to how individuals utilize these roles and how they influence and are influenced by the systems they are part of.

## Environments and System Interactions

In the world, everything is interconnected; that's why we identify systems by focusing our attention on them—just as we distinguish the parts of an elephant. Shifting between system levels changes everything—including the names of systems, roles, etc. [^2] While analyzing these interconnections, the role of changes in the surroundings should not be underestimated, as they directly influence the configuration and performance of the system of interest and its related systems.

A person with systems thinking literally speaks a systems language, formulates system descriptions, and creates successful systems. To achieve this, one must be adept at handling various interests, which are accommodated (satisfied) through the formation of a system description.

## Conclusion

The path from understanding basic system components to mastering how they function cohesively within larger frameworks is intricate yet rewarding. As defined here, the "system of interest," "supersystem," and "creation system" offer a foundational perspective for learners and professionals aspiring towards thinking mastery in systems management.

[ ^1 ]: In the previous subsection, we already discussed that most people operate with a colloquial understanding of systems thinking and confuse the concepts of using a systems approach and systematicity.
