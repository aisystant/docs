# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 4.6. Services

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table, and if necessary, review the theoretical material related to the "service" concept. Pay attention to the difference between the concepts of "service" and "system of interest." Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Note that the presented data may fit a large number of different scenarios; it is sufficient for you to describe any variant. The main thing is to avoid obvious mistakes.

Describe the services your company uses and provides, as well as those you personally use and provide.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
