# Example of a Service - "Haircut"

Let's consider an example with a hair salon. A hair salon is part of the service sector. It doesn't produce system products in the way an automotive plant does. If you ask anyone what a hair salon does, they will answer that it cuts hair.

Thus, a hair salon provides a service—haircuts. It offers an outwardly standardized set of actions: a Canadian cut, a model cut, and so on. When we speak about a hair salon, it is appropriate to use terms like "service" and "service industry."

However, a hair salon is a system-enterprise, which means it has a system of interest that the salon creates as a creation system. This system of interest is the hairstyle. The supersystem for the hairstyle might be a well-groomed head or a lady ready for an evening at the theater. In turn, the surrounding systems could be makeup, earrings, and a dress.

Not every part of the hair salon is involved in the haircut service, so it's more accurate to define the parts of the enterprise directly engaged in this procedure. This includes the hairdresser and their tools (technologies), such as scissors^[Scissors, in turn, also provide a service—cutting.], clippers, combs, etc. So, there is an internal process involving the hairdresser with the scissors, and there is an external service that is delivered as a result of this internal process. A system constructor might discuss these separately; hence there are different concepts—for the process, the service, and the systems.

Furthermore, the system of scissors is created specifically for a functional purpose. The creators of scissors must understand well the intended or requested function^[The creators of scissors follow the principle: "the finger presses on the table, but the table does not press on the finger." This means scissors are an active object that cuts hair, providing a service. Hair is considered a passive object. The impact of hair on scissors is neglected when considering the functional (role-based) behavior of scissors. However, the reverse consideration is also possible. It's all about focus. It's impossible to simultaneously consider all interactions and influences. For more details on why systems thinking uses the principle of Aristotelian rather than Newtonian physics, refer to the "Aristotelian Physics in Systems Thinking" section of the "Systems Thinking" textbook.]. It's one scenario if the user is a hairdresser and quite another if they are a gardener. Although the principle of how scissors work is the same, the hairdresser has hair scissors created for them, while the gardener uses a pruner (garden scissors).

If you find this example unclear, be sure to reflect on it using thinking through writing. Also, note any questions you might want to ask in the support chat of the "Systems Thinking" course. For those who understand this example, try to come up with a similar one.
