title: Supersystem, System Levels, and Recursion

Below, you see a diagram that presents the same types of systems discussed earlier, but from a slightly different perspective. This diagram from the textbook "Systems Thinking" demonstrates how the delineation of different systems occurs in relation to a system of interest. If we speak of a supersystem, it implies the presence of a system of interest, and if there is a creation system, it corresponds with a system of interest.

However, before identifying the system of interest, it is necessary to understand your roles, team, and enterprise. This understanding helps define your responsibilities and authorities, which determine the system level, boundaries of the system of interest, and our system. You may be granted the authority to create a piston, the entire engine, or the vehicle as a whole. Once you choose the system of interest, you can then structure all other systems, including defining "our system". Conversely, sometimes you have a clear understanding of "our system" and only then start searching for a system of interest.

What should you do first with the supersystem? You need to ensure that the system of interest, when in operation, is an integral, physical part of this system, meaning it literally forms part of the supersystem. For example, a pump is part of a pumping station. Unfortunately, most mistakes occur due to inattentiveness to this feature of the supersystem.

The same system of interest can have multiple supersystems. It depends on the context of using the system of interest. For example, a supersystem for a vehicle might be "driver+vehicle+passenger". On the other hand, a vehicle can also be considered in the context of a garage where it is parked, thus making the garage with the vehicle another supersystem for the vehicle. Multiple such supersystems can exist, each determining project roles, surrounding systems, needs, etc.

System breakdowns or system levels refer to the nestedness of systems within one another: a subsystem is part of the system of interest, which is in turn part of the supersystem. However, the creation system is not included within this system breakdown and is therefore highlighted separately in the diagram.

From the diagram, another important principle can be deduced, which is a form of recursion. The supersystem of our project can be considered a system of interest for our clients, and our system of interest can be a supersystem for someone else.

The naming of system types depends on the team working at a specific system level. They have the authority and responsibility for systems at the corresponding level. For one team, the system of interest might be the vehicle, with the battery being a subsystem. However, your team might perfectly well designate the battery as the system of interest, particularly since it is used in different supersystems: in vehicles, homes, etc.

There is no absolute template or strict rule on how to name systems. Each team independently decides how to name what they work withâ€”be it "our system" or the "system of interest." This is also the task of the visionary. Systems thinking simply requires adhering to the principle of physical nestedness while separately considering surrounding systems and creation systems, along with employing other thinking skills.
