# Supersystem, System Levels, and Recursion

The diagram below presents the same types of systems discussed earlier but from a slightly different angle. This illustration from the "Systems Thinking" textbook demonstrates that identifying different systems is done concerning a particular system of interest. If we speak of a supersystem, then there is a system of interest, and if there is a creation system, it always corresponds to a system of interest.

However, before identifying a system of interest, it's important to understand your roles, team, and organization. This understanding helps define your responsibilities and authorities, which determine the system level, as well as the boundaries of the system of interest and our system. You might be authorized to create a piston, an entire engine, or a car as a whole. Once you choose the system of interest, you can then build all other systems, including defining "our system." Sometimes it happens the other way around: you have a good understanding of "our system" and only then start searching for the system of interest.

What should be done first with the supersystem? It is essential to ensure that the system of interest, during its operation, is an integral, physical part of this system, literally a part of the supersystem. For example, a pump is part of a pumping station. Unfortunately, most mistakes occur due to inattention to this characteristic of a supersystem.

The same system of interest can have multiple supersystems. It all depends on the context of using the system of interest. For instance, the supersystem of a car could be the "driver+car+passenger" [ ^1 ]. On the other hand, a car can also be considered in the context of a garage where it is parked. Thus, the garage with the car is another separate supersystem for the system of interest, the car. There can be several such supersystems. Each such consideration defines the project roles, surrounding systems, needs, etc.

System breakdowns or system levels refer to the nestedness of systems within each other: a subsystem is part of a system of interest, and that, in turn, is part of a supersystem. However, the creation system does not fit into this system breakdown, which is why it is highlighted separately in the illustration.

Another crucial principle can be deduced from the illustration. It is a peculiar form of recursion. The supersystem of our project might be called the system of interest for our clients, and our system of interest might serve as a supersystem for someone else.

The naming of types of systems depends on the team working at a specific system level. It has the authority and responsibility for systems at the corresponding level. For one team, the car might be the system of interest, while the battery might be a subsystem. However, your team might very well designate the battery as the system of interest, particularly since it will be used in different supersystems: cars, houses, etc.

There is no definitive template or strict rule on how to name systems. Each team independently decides how to label what it works with—“our system” or “system of interest.” This is also a task for the visionary. Using a systems approach simply requires adhering to the principle of physical nestedness while also separately considering surrounding systems and creation systems, along with other thinking techniques.

[ ^1 ]: It is difficult to find a name for such a system, perhaps "equipped crew"? Here, different project roles emerge, as well as surrounding systems (asphalt road or dirt road, pedestrians or wild animals, etc.).
