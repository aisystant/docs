# Supersystem, System Levels, and Recursion

In the diagram below, you see the same types of systems previously discussed, but with a slightly different perspective. This diagram from the book "Systems Thinking" illustrates that different systems are identified in relation to a particular system of interest. When we speak of a supersystem, it implies the presence of a system of interest, and if there is a creation system, it always corresponds to a system of interest.

However, before identifying a system of interest, it is necessary to understand your roles, your team, and your enterprise. This understanding allows you to determine your responsibility and authorities, which influence the system level, the boundaries of the system of interest, and our system. You might be given the authority to create a piston, an entire engine, or a vehicle as a whole. Once you choose the system of interest, you can then structure all other systems, including identifying our system. But sometimes it’s the other way around: you have a good understanding of our system and only then begin to search for the system of interest.

What should be done first with the supersystem? It is essential to ensure that the system of interest, during its operation, is an integral, physical part of this system, meaning it must literally be part of the supersystem. For example, a pump is part of a pumping station. Unfortunately, most errors occur due to inattentiveness to this characteristic of the supersystem.

A single system of interest may have multiple supersystems. It all depends on the context in which the system of interest is used. For instance, for a vehicle, the supersystem might be "driver+vehicle+passenger" [ ^1 ]. On the other hand, a vehicle can be considered in the context of a garage where it is parked. In that case, the garage with the vehicle is also a separate supersystem for the vehicle as the system of interest. There can be multiple such supersystems. Each consideration identifies project roles, surrounding systems, needs, etc.

System breakdowns or system levels involve the nestedness of systems within each other: a subsystem is part of the system of interest, which in turn is part of the supersystem. However, the creation system is not included in this system breakdown, which is why it is highlighted separately in the diagram.

The diagram also reveals another important principle: a kind of recursion. The supersystem of our project may be considered the system of interest for our clients, and our system of interest might be a supersystem for someone else.

The names of the types of systems depend on the team working at a particular system level. The team has authorities and responsibilities for systems at the corresponding level. For one team, a vehicle might be the system of interest, while a battery is a subsystem. However, your team may very well designate the battery as the system of interest, particularly because it could be used in various supersystems such as vehicles, homes, etc.

There is no clear template or strict rule for naming systems. Each team independently determines how to label what they are working with—whether it is our system or the system of interest. This task also belongs to the visionary. Systems thinking merely requires adhering to the principle of physical nestedness, while also giving separate consideration to surrounding systems and creation systems, as well as other thinking mastery techniques.

[ ^1 ]: It’s challenging to find a specific name for such a system, perhaps "equipped crew"? Here, various project roles emerge, as well as surrounding systems (such as paved roads or dirt roads, pedestrians or wild animals, etc.).
