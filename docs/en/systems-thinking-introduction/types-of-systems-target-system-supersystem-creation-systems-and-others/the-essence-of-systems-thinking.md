# The Essence of Systems Thinking

By understanding all types of systems, you will be able to quickly navigate any complex activity faster than others. You can literally dissect the world into parts with your attention, identifying specific systems. The world is complex, and all its elements are interconnected. The human brain finds it challenging to grasp all connections, which is why systems thinking sets out principles for logically dividing the world into parts. It's much easier to understand individual parts this way, while still maintaining their connection to everything else.

For example, on the left side of this diagram from the "Systems Thinking" course [ ^1 ], you can see the system levels in relation to the system of interest, marked by the red circle. At the top level is the supersystem (large circle containing the red circle), within which lies the system of interest (red circle), with two surrounding systems at this same system level. On the system level inside the system of interest, we see three subsystems. This schema suits our example with a passenger vehicle well. Try to match the vehicle with its subsystems, driver, and passenger yourself.

Beyond the dashed line lie numerous creation systems. Some of them create the supersystem, others are systems creating the system of interest, and a third category participates in creating subsystems. This schema can be used to discuss not only a passenger vehicle or a factory but also the system that builds a factory. Of course, such complex schemes are not always necessary, but it's important to understand that systems thinking helps in reviewing the most complex systems and activities. Try using this schema to consider the activities of your organization. I'll be upfront: it will be quite challenging. We delve into student cases in more detail during workshops with the instructor.
