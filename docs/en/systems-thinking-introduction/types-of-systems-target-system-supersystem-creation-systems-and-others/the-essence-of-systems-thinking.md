title: The Essence of Systems Thinking
---

By understanding all kinds of systems, you will be able to grasp any complex activity faster than others. You can figuratively dissect the world into parts with your attention, highlighting specific systems. The world is complex, and all its elements are connected. The human brain finds it challenging to grasp all the connections, which is why systems thinking establishes principles on how to logically divide the world into parts. It becomes much easier to comprehend individual parts, while still maintaining their connection to everything else.

For instance, on the left side of the diagram from the course "Systems Thinking,"^[You will become more familiar with this diagram when describing your activities and identifying appropriate systems.] you can see system levels in relation to the system of interest, marked by a red circle. At the top level is the supersystem (the large circle containing the red circle), within which is the system of interest (the red circle), and on this same system level are two surrounding systems. On the system level inside the system of interest, we see three subsystems. Our example with a car fits well with this scheme. Try to associate the car with its subsystems, the driver, and the passenger.

Beyond the dotted line are numerous creation systems. Some create the supersystem, others are systems for creating the system of interest, and others participate in creating subsystems. This diagram can discuss not just the automobile and the factory, but also the system that builds the factory. It's true that such complex schemes are not always necessary, but it is important to understand that systems thinking helps in examining the most complex systems and activities. Attempt to use this diagram to examine the activities of your organization. I'll note that this can be quite challenging. We explore student cases in more detail during trainings with an instructor.
