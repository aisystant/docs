In various ways, surrounding systems interact with the system of interest. For example, for a vehicle, the surrounding systems include the driver, passenger, road, pedestrian, etc. There are systems in the immediate surroundings and those in the remote surroundings. The systems in the immediate surroundings, along with the system of interest, comprise the supersystem. In our example, in the trip, besides the vehicle, the driver and passenger are included. The systems in the remote surroundings are those that interact with the system of interest during its operation. For instance, these would be the road and pedestrian.

Subsystems^[All three main systems have subsystems, but if not specified, it is assumed to refer to the system of interest.] are parts of the system of interest. For a vehicle, subsystems include the engine, interior, chassis, etc. These subsystems are physically part of the system of interest, which in turn serves as a subsystem for the supersystem.

Ultimately, the chain of subsystem-system of interest-supersystem represents system levels. Follow the arrows in the diagram: from "Subsystems," an arrow "enters" the "System of Interest," and the "System of Interest" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of the vehicle, and the vehicle is part of the household.

The system-creator, consisting of creation systems, is not included in the system levels. Its relationship with the system of interest is instead one of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the system of interest and the supersystem is one of nestedness or a "part-whole" relationship.
