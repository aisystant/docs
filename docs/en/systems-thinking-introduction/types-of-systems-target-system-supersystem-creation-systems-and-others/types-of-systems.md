# Types of Systems

Systems in the surroundings interact with the system of interest in various ways. For example, for a car, the systems in the surroundings include the driver and passenger, as well as the road, pedestrian, and so on. There are systems in the immediate surroundings and in the distant surroundings. Systems in the immediate surroundings, together with the system of interest, form the supersystem. In our example, the trip includes not only the car but also the driver and passenger. Systems in the distant surroundings are those systems that interact with the system of interest during its operation. For instance, the road and the pedestrian.

Subsystems [ ^1 ] are parts of the system of interest. For a car, subsystems include the engine, interior, chassis, etc. Subsystems are physically part of the system of interest, which in turn is a subsystem for the supersystem.

Ultimately, the chain "subsystem-system of interest-supersystem" symbolizes system levels. Trace the arrows in the diagram: from "Subsystems," the arrow "enters" the "System of Interest," and the "System of Interest" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of a car, and a car is part of a household.

The system-creator, which consists of creation systems, does not belong to the system levels. It has a different relationship with the system of interestâ€”a relationship of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the system of interest and the supersystem is one of nestedness or a "part-whole" relationship.

[ ^1 ]: Subsystems exist in all three main systems, but if it is not specified which system is being discussed, it is always assumed to be the system of interest.
