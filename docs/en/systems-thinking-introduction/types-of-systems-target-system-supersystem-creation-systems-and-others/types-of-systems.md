# Types of Systems

Different systems in the surroundings interact with the system of interest in various ways. For example, for a car, the systems in the surroundings include the driver and passenger, as well as the road, pedestrian, and so forth. There are systems in the near surroundings and in the distant surroundings. Systems in the near surroundings, together with the system of interest, constitute the supersystem. In our example, along with the car, the driver and passenger are included in the trip. Systems in the distant surroundings are those that interact with the system of interest during its operation. For example, the road and pedestrian.

Subsystems [ ^1 ] are components of the system of interest. For a car, subsystems include the engine, interior, chassis, and so on. Subsystems are physically part of the system of interest, and in turn, the system of interest is a subsystem for the supersystem.

Ultimately, the chain of subsystem-system of interest-supersystem represents system levels. Follow the arrows on the diagram: from "Subsystems," an arrow "enters" the "System of Interest," and the "System of Interest" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of the car, and the car is part of the household.

The system-creator, which consists of creation systems, is not part of the system levels. It has a different relationship with the system of interestâ€”a relationship of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the system of interest and the supersystem is one of nestedness or a "part-whole" relationship.

[ ^1 ]: Subsystems exist for all three main systems; however, if it is not specified which system is being referred to, it is always assumed to be the system of interest.
