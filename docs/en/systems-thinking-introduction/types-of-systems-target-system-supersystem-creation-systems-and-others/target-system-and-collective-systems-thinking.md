# System of Interest and Collective Systems Thinking

The system of interest is shared by the entire collective or members of the extended enterprise! It is essential for managing collective activities and, primarily, collective attention. Thanks to the concept of the "system of interest," every team member understands that they participate in a larger endeavor and that their work results contribute to the team's overall outcome (or the creation systems collectives). However, each individual in a role or enterprise division may have their own system, which they create or develop. This is called "our system."

The system of interest focuses the attention of a large team of system-creators on a common goal. Recall the story from 1962 at NASA's space center, where President John Kennedy asked a janitor with a mop in hand what he was doing. "I'm helping to put a man on the Moon, Mr. President." For the janitor, the "our system" would be a clean floor. He literally creates it with a mop, bucket, and cloth.

In the same way, at a large corporation like BMW, various teams create the engine, the conveyor, the factory cafeteria, and so on. For all of them, the system of interest is the "car." However, "our system" for each team would be the engine, the conveyor, and the cafeteria.

The choice of the system of interest is subjective, and the entrepreneur, whom we will call the visionary^[The word "entrepreneur" has many diverse meanings, so it is always better to provide clarification.], is responsible for it. Of course, many team members can participate in gathering information, analysis, and decision-making, but the final decision regarding the system of interest rests with the visionary. It is this individual-agent in the role of the visionary who takes the risk. Many other decisions depend on their choice.

For example, Henry Ford, in the role of visionary entrepreneur, decided that instead of a horse-drawn carriage, a self-propelled vehicle should be made^[Note that a word for this system might not yet exist.]. Then, engineers thought about how this system should be structured. Systems are created collectively, involving numerous roles. The final structure of the system of interest (its design, function, internal structure, etc.) depends on considering all stakeholders, not just the visionary. However, there is no guarantee that the chosen system of interest is correct. This is entrepreneurial work: proposing a hypothesis and testing it. Entrepreneurial risk must be taken.

Systems thinking simplifies this process, though it does not eliminate the need to propose an entrepreneurial hypothesis. Nevertheless, it protects against obvious mistakes. For example, systems thinking requires ensuring that the system of interest is indeed physical, not documentation or something that does not change anything significant in the physical world. It also draws attention to the supersystem, the target audience's problems, the needs of external project roles, and other work artifacts across various areas of interest. In essence, systems thinking offers a checklist that, while it does not guarantee the success of the system of interest, protects against beginner's mistakes^[Such beginner mistakes are more likely to arise when you deal with something new, complex, and unknown.].

It should be noted that most employees work in projects where the system of interest has already been defined^[Although it often happens that a project is in full swing, few understand the system of interest. Nevertheless, it exists, even if team members are unaware of its presence.]. Someone in the visionary role previously selected the system of interest and launched a project to create, change, and improve it. Beginners in systems thinking need to practice identifying the system of interest in existing businesses, and only then, if necessary, take on the role of visionary^[You will have to act as a visionary, at least in personal projects.] and independently determine the system of interest in their work and personal projects.
