**The System of Interest – A Common Goal for the Collective or Extended Enterprise Members!**

The system of interest serves to manage collective activities, and primarily, collective attention. This concept helps every team member recognize their involvement in a larger endeavor, where their individual work results are part of the entire collective's effort (creation systems collectives). However, each person in a role or an enterprise unit may have their own system that they are creating or developing, known as "our system."

The system of interest channels the attention of the large system-creator team towards a unified objective. Recalling a story from 1962 at NASA’s space center, President John F. Kennedy asked a janitor with a mop in hand what he was doing. "Mr. President, I am helping to put a man on the moon," he replied. For the janitor, “our system” was a clean floor, which he created with a mop, bucket, and cloth.

Similarly, within the large BMW automotive corporation, numerous teams are involved in creating engines, assembly lines, factory cafeterias, and more. Yet for all of them, the system of interest is the "car," while “our system” for each team might be the engine, assembly line, or cafeteria.

The choice of the system of interest is subjective and is the responsibility of the entrepreneur—whom we shall call the visionary. While many team members may participate in gathering information, analyzing, and deciding, the final decision regarding the system of interest rests on the visionary. This visionary puts their "skin in the game," making choices that affect many other decisions.

For instance, Henry Ford, as an entrepreneur visionary, decided to replace horse-drawn carriages with a self-propelled vehicle^[Note that there might not yet be a term for this system.]. Engineers then figured out how this system should be designed. Systems are created collectively, involving numerous roles, and the final design of the system of interest (its design, function, internal structure, etc.) depends on considering all stakeholders, not just the visionary. However, there is no guarantee that the chosen system of interest is correct. This is entrepreneurial work: hypotheses must be proposed and tested, and entrepreneurial risk is inevitable.

Systems thinking simplifies this process but does not eliminate the need for entrepreneurial hypothesis development. It can, however, help avoid obvious mistakes. For instance, systems thinking will require verifying that the system of interest is indeed physical, not merely documentation or something that does not fundamentally change the physical world. It also calls attention to the supersystem, target audience issues, external project roles' needs, and other work artifacts from various areas of interest. Essentially, systems thinking offers a checklist, which, while it does not guarantee system success, helps avoid the mistakes newcomers are more likely to make when dealing with something new, complex, and unknown.

It should be noted that most employees work on projects where the system of interest has already been defined^[Although often projects are in full swing, few understand the system of interest. Nevertheless, it exists; team members simply may not recognize its presence.]. Someone, in the role of the visionary, previously selected the system of interest, launching the project for its creation, modification, and improvement. For those beginning to study systems thinking, it is necessary to practice identifying the system of interest in existing businesses first, and then, if required, take on the visionary role^[And you will need to take on the visionary role, at least in personal projects.] to independently determine the system of interest in your work and personal projects.
