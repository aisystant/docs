# Our System

The concept of "our system" enables an individual or team to identify their system or their place within a larger collective activity. This could involve the operations of your company or multiple companies. In the latter case, one can speak of an extended enterprise. For example, various companies participate in sending a person into space.

Note that our system can be a subsystem of the system of interest or one of the creation systems. Thus, the activities of a large enterprise can be divided into multiple projects responsible for creating different "our systems." Any "our system" maintains a certain connection with the system of interest.

A systems team and a systems specialist must understand how they contribute to the larger activity of creating the system of interest. An essential aspect of systems thinking is the ability to identify one's system among many others, as well as to understand its connection with other systems and teams that create these systems.

In an extended enterprise, numerous teams work, each focusing on its own system ("our system" is unique to each). For example, a team might be creating a car engine, which means that for this team, "our system" is the engine. In this case, the team would still consider the car as their system of interest. This establishes a connection between the team and the larger collective that produces the car. For the team, the engine is "our system." Here, "our system" is part of the system of interest. However, for another team within the automotive corporation, "our system" might be the assembly line, considering it part of the creation system in relation to the car.

To emphasize once again, our system and the system of interest help people within a company see their specific area of work and understand how their efforts contribute to the main result for the entire enterprise.
