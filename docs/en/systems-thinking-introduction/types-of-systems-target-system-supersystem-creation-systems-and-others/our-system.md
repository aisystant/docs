# Our System

The concept of "our system" allows an individual or team to identify their system or their place within a larger collective activity. This could involve activities within your enterprise or across multiple enterprises. In the latter case, we can speak of an extended enterprise. For example, a variety of enterprises may participate in sending a person into space.

It's important to note that our system could be a subsystem of the system of interest or one of the creation systems. Thus, the activities of a large enterprise can be divided into numerous projects, each responsible for creating different "our systems." At the same time, every "our system" is connected in some way to the system of interest.

A systems team and systems specialist must comprehend how they partake in the broader activity of creating the system of interest. An essential method in systems thinking is the ability to identify one's system among many others and understand its connection to other systems and the teams creating those systems.

In an extended enterprise, numerous teams work, each focusing on its system ("our system" specific to each). For instance, a team might be developing a car engine, making the engine "our system" for them. However, they will still consider the car their system of interest. This connection ties the team to the larger group producing the car. For that team, the engine is "our system." In this scenario, "our system" is a part of the system of interest. For another team within an automotive corporation, "our system" might be the assembly line, which, in relation to the car, is a part of the creation system.

To reiterate, "our system" and the system of interest help people within an enterprise see their specific work area and comprehend how their work connects to the enterprise's overall primary outcome.
