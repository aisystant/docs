# Our System

The concept of "our system" allows an individual or a team to identify their own system or their place within a large-scale collective operation. This can pertain to activities of your organization or multiple organizations and, in the latter case, one could refer to it as an extended enterprise. For example, various organizations contribute to sending a person into space.

Note that our system could be a subsystem of the system of interest or one of the creation systems. Thus, the activities of a large enterprise can be divided into numerous projects responsible for creating different "our systems." In this scenario, any "our system" maintains a particular connection to the system of interest.

A systems team and a systems specialist must understand how they partake in the major endeavor of creating the system of interest. A vital aspect of using a systems approach is the ability to identify your own system among many others, as well as to comprehend its connection with other systems and teams that create these systems.

In an extended enterprise, a vast number of teams operate, each focusing on their own system (“our system” is distinct for each team). For instance, a team might be developing a car engine, meaning "our system" for this team would be the engine. In this case, they would still consider the car their system of interest. This defines their connection with the larger collective that produces the car. Here, the engine serves as "our system" for the team. In this context, "our system" is a part of the system of interest. However, for a team within an automotive corporation, "our system" might be the assembly line, whereas, concerning the car, the assembly line is part of the creation system.

Let's reiterate that our system and the system of interest help people within an enterprise directly visualize their specific area of work and understand how their contributions relate to the main result for the entire enterprise.
