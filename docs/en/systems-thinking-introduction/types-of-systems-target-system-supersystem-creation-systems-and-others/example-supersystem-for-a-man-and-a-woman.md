# Example: Supersystem for a Man and a Woman

Let's consider an everyday example with agents such as a man and a woman. What supersystems might exist that involve them in specific roles? Yes, they interact in some way, and they have functionality within the supersystem. What kind?

I hope you quickly realized that in this case, the supersystem could be a family, and the woman and man are in each other's systems environment, performing roles as husband and wife. In other words, a family consists not of a woman and a man, but of a husband and a wife.

You can solve the puzzle about the name of the supersystem by identifying a missing, unnamed, or undiscovered system in the system breakdown. This is a common situation: supersystems are usually not easily discernible, and sometimes they lack established names [ ^1 ]. 

These "missing" systems need to be identified, which means describing their roles or functions and naming them by role somehow. Sometimes you'll need to choose the most accurate words. For example, for a vehicle with a driver and a passenger, a supersystem needs to be identified, but as of yet, there is no good option. Once you find a suitable name for the system, much becomes clearer and simpler. Learn to name systems correctly and work with semantics [ ^2 ].

[ ^1 ]: Often in culture, there are no established names for certain systems, unlike the concept of "family." In your work projects, you will often need to introduce new system names. Remember that the name should be given according to the main function of the system.
