# Process, System, and System Behavior

Systems of creation should not be confused with the process of creating the system of interest. More specifically, one should not confuse a system with a process. We state that different systems participate in the creation process, which we refer to as the systems of creation. Collectively, they form the system-creator.

Accordingly, when we use the term "process," we mean the interaction of different systems resulting in the creation of a work artifact. If systems of creation are involved in this process, the resulting work artifact is the system of interest. For instance, if it's a process of thinking through writing that involves a thinker and a computer (exocortex), the result is a work artifact in the form of a draft post on the computer.

Sometimes, it is easy to identify a supersystem for all systems participating in a certain process. For example, consider the process of fuel mixture combustion, which involves the piston, cylinder, crank-and-rod mechanism, crankshaft, cooling subsystem, etc. All these systems together form the internal combustion engine (ICE). However, sometimes either the perspective is lacking, or there is no common cultural term for such a supersystem (as with the ICE). Nonetheless, you should not confuse the names of the process and the systems, as in the example above.

Systems participating in a process change their state or display certain behaviors. Behavior describes the interaction of a system with its surroundings, referred to as "external behavior" or "role behavior." For example, there are distinct behaviors of all the aforementioned systems participating in the combustion process. Similarly, within a clock, there's a process of counting seconds involving gears, springs, and other subsystems of the clock. However, behavior is also present in the engine itself, which, along with the chassis and cabin, participates in another process—the transportation of goods and passengers. The work artifact of this process is goods and passengers moved through space.

Thus, we should not confuse different types of concepts—process, system, and role behavior.
