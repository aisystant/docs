# Process, System, and System Behavior

Creation systems should not be confused with the process of creating the system of interest. Specifically, do not confuse systems with processes. When we discuss the process of creation, we mean [ ^1 ] the involvement of different systems, which we call creation systems. Together, they form the system-creator.

Therefore, when we say "process" [ ^2 ], we refer to the interaction of different systems resulting in a work artifact. If creation systems participate in this process, the resulting work artifact is the system of interest. In the case of thinking through writing, involving a thinker and a computer (exocortex), the process results in a work artifact—a draft post in the computer.

At times, it is easy to identify a supersystem for all the systems participating in a process. For example, consider the combustion process involving a piston, cylinder, connecting rod mechanism, crankshaft, cooling subsystem, and so on. All these systems form an internal combustion engine (ICE). However, sometimes, our perspective is limited, or there is no common cultural term for such a supersystem (like ICE). Nevertheless, you should not confuse the names of processes and systems, as illustrated in the example above.

The systems participating in the process change their state or exhibit specific behavior. Behavior describes the system's interaction with its environment, known as "external behavior" or "role-based behavior." For instance, each of the aforementioned systems [ ^3 ] in the combustion process exhibits distinct behaviors [ ^4 ]. Similarly, inside a clock, there is also a process of counting seconds, involving gears, springs, and other clock subsystems. But the engine itself also displays behavior [ ^5 ] and, alongside the chassis and cabin, participates in another process—transportation operations. The work artifact of this process is the moved cargo and passengers.

Thus, we must distinguish between different types of concepts—process, system, and role-based behavior.

[ ^1 ]: This refers to the "relationship of involvement" in some activity (changes, processes, procedures)—a specialization of the "composition relationship."  
[ ^2 ]: Outside of Aisystant, the word "process" can be used as a synonym for the concept of "practice." However, we differentiate between "process" and "practice"; they are distinct types.  
[ ^3 ]: The piston behaves one way, the cylinder another.  
[ ^4 ]: Or, for example, within a clock, there is a process of counting seconds, involving gears, springs, and other clock subsystems.  
[ ^5 ]: Providing torque output.
