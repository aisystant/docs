# Function and Service

The system of interest is conceived as a delivered product (physical object). Such a system is generally manufactured by a project team from materials procured by the team and then physically delivered to the consumer. It is at the consumer’s end that the product performs the requested function, operating as part of the supersystem during use.

For example, if you are a watch manufacturer, the watch would be your system of interest. Clients use your systems of interest in two ways:

* First, as part of their system of interest. For instance, your watch-product is installed by a client in their car-product, which is then sold to their customer, and the watch displays time during the car's usage;
* Second, the client uses the watch as part of the creation system for their car (the car being the product of your client). For example, your watch-product might be installed on a wall in their factory so that workers can keep track of time during car assembly.

An alternative is to trade in services rather than product-systems. Suppose you can send the exact time upon request. Perhaps for a car and a factory, a watch-product is more preferred than a service providing time information upon request. However, there is a well-known example of a service—taxi services. You could sell a car-product, or you could offer a transportation service.

To provide a service, you need to create a system that will produce this service. In doing so, you don't sell the system; instead, the client pays for the service rendered. If we consider the example of a car, it is a product. You can sell a car for the client to assume the driver's role and also be the passenger, essentially driving themselves. Alternatively, you can offer a transportation service, where the client only plays the passenger's role. Your system, which organizes the transportation service, at a minimum, comprises the car and a driver who is your employee.

A creation system usually offers services, meaning an enterprise. A good example is a hotel service. There is a hotel providing accommodation and lodging services.

Service implies behavior, work, service. It is delivered by a service enterprise or system: service equipment, server, department, provider. Do you feel the difference in the words?

Let’s remember that we also referred to system behavior as a function. By nature, a function and a service are indistinguishable. They both represent system behavior (functional or role-based). But why do we need two different concepts?

It's all about the different jargon unique to two perspectives. The term "function" is used by external project roles looking to achieve specific behavior in the supersystem. We say that a system's function is assigned externally; it is needed in the supersystem. The term "service" is used by internal project roles creating the system to outwardly deliver the service. Whether the service delivered becomes the requested function will determine success.

Therefore, the term “service” reflects the system's view of its environment. The reverse view, from the environment/supersystem back to the system, is the function. A function may even be called something else entirely. The service of hammering a nail might be the function of joining boards together. And the service of water suction might become the function of antifreeze injection.

Function describes the system behavior from the supersystem's standpoint, where clients need a specific function. Service describes system behavior from its developer's standpoint, where they say, "I don’t know why it’s needed, but I can change the environment (the world) with a specific service." Or the term function could be used to consider a system's behavior in the supersystem [ ^1 ] as a functional or role-based object. Meanwhile, the term service is used to consider system behavior in the supersystem as a constructive object. Generally, service denotes the behavior of a creation system impacting the system of interest.

So don't be surprised when you hear two completely different discussions about the same item, the same product, and the same behavior: it's the specificity of different interests.

Often clients may express dissatisfaction with the provided service. This means clients expect certain functions, but the quality of service delivery doesn't meet their expectations. For instance, you spend a night in a hotel. You need to get a good night's sleep, take a shower, and so on. This view falls under needs and functions. Then there's the perspective from the management and other roles designing and managing the hotel. Here, the management team considers the services provided to guests. If the subsystems and the entire hotel are poorly designed [ ^2 ], complaints about service quality arise. Clients can't criticize their requests (i.e., they don't use the function slang), so they criticize in the language of the management company—saying the service [ ^3 ] is poor.

It's crucial to understand that manufacturers and service-oriented companies aim to name their system-products and services so that potential buyers can quickly see their functional requests in them. How well this succeeds is determined by the market.

In this context, companies need to properly position their services to avoid unintended use by people outside the target audience. For instance, if Aisystant were to offer its current educational services to schoolchildren or fans of easy learning, we would certainly receive feedback about the inadequate quality of education.

[ ^1 ]: Or subsystem within a system.
[ ^2 ]: For example, if the needs of the hotel’s target audience are poorly understood.
[ ^3 ]: As we know, the term “service” is used by the creation team.
