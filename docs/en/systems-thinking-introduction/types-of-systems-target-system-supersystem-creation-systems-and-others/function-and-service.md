# Function and Service

The system of interest is conceived as a delivered product (a physical object). Such a system is usually manufactured by a project team from the raw materials procured by the team and then physically delivered to the consumer. At the consumer's end, this product performs the requested function, operating as part of the supersystem during its use.

For instance, if you are a watch manufacturer, your watches are the system of interest. Clients use your systems of interest in two ways:

* The first is as part of their own system of interest. For example, your watch-product is installed by the client in their car-product, and then the car is sold to their customer, with the watch displaying the time during the car's usage.
* The second is when the client uses the watch within the creation system for their car product (the car is your client's product). For example, your watch-product is installed by the client on the workshop wall so that workers can keep track of time during the assembly process.

An alternative is to trade not in system-products but rather in services. Hypothetically, you could send the exact time upon request. It's possible that for both the car and the workshop, a watch-product might be preferred over a time-providing service. However, there is a well-known example of a service—taxi. You can sell a car-product, or you can provide transportation services.

To offer a service, you need to create a system that will produce that service. In this case, you don't sell the system; the client pays you for the service provided. If we take the example of a car, it is a product. You can sell the car, allowing the client to serve as both the driver and passenger—that is, driving themselves. Alternatively, you can offer the client a transportation service, where the client is only the passenger. Your system, which organizes the transportation service, includes at minimum a car and a driver in the role of your employee.

Typically, a service is offered by a creation system, i.e., an enterprise. A good example is the hotel service. There is a hotel that provides stay and lodging services.

A service is behavior, work, or service. It is provided by a service enterprise or system: service equipment, a server, a service, or a provider. Do you notice the differences in the words?

Let's recall that we also referred to system behavior as a function. By nature, a function and a service are not different. It's all system behavior (functional or role-based). But why are two different concepts needed?

The answer lies in the fact that these are different slangs characteristic of two different perspectives. The term "function" is used by external project roles that wish to receive a specific behavior in the supersystem. We say that the function of the system is assigned from outside; it is needed in the supersystem. The term "service" is used by internal project roles that create the system, which is supposed to emit a service outward. Whether the issued service becomes the requested function will determine success.

Thus, the term "service" reflects the view of the system towards its environment. Conversely, the view from the environment/supersystem towards the system is the function. And indeed, the function may have a different name. The service of hammering nails might be a function of fastening boards. And the service of sucking water can become a function of pumping antifreeze.

A function is the system's behavior from the supersystem's perspective when clients need a specific function. A service is the system's behavior from the developer's perspective when they say, "I don't know why it's needed, but I can change the environment (world) with a specific service." Or the term function could be used to consider the behavior of a system in the supersystem [ ^1 ]. The term service could be used to consider the behavior of a system in the supersystem as a constructive object. Most often, a service indicates the behavior of a creation system that influences the system of interest.

Don't be surprised when you hear two very different conversations about the same object, the same product, and the same behavior: this is the peculiarity of different interests.

Often, clients may say that the provided service does not satisfy them. This means that clients expect to receive a certain function, but the quality of service delivery does not meet their expectations. For example, you spend a night in a hotel. You need to sleep well, take a shower, etc. This is one perspective. And it occurs in terms of needs and functions. However, there is another perspective from the manager and other roles who design and manage the hotel. Here, the management team considers the services provided to guests. If the subsystems and the hotel as a whole are poorly designed [ ^2 ], complaints about service quality arise. Clients cannot criticize their requests (that is, they do not use the terminology related to functions), so they criticize the language of the management company and claim that specifically the service [ ^3 ] is subpar.

It's crucial to understand that manufacturers and service-oriented companies want to name their system-products and services in such a way that potential buyers quickly see their functional requests. How well they achieve this is determined by the market.

In this context, it is important for companies to properly position their services so that they are not accidentally used by people outside their target audience. For instance, if Aisystant offers its current educational services to schoolchildren or casual learners, we would undoubtedly receive feedback about poor-quality education.

[ ^2 ]: For instance, if the needs of the target audience are poorly understood.
[ ^3 ]: As we know, the term "service" is used by the creation team.
