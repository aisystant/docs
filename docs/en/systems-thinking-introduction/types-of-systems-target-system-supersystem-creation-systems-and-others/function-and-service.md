# Function and Service

The system of interest is conceived as a deliverable product (physical object). Such a system is typically built by a project team from materials procured by the team and then physically delivered to the consumer. At the consumer's end, this product performs the requested function, operating as part of a supersystem during its utilization.

For example, if you are a watch manufacturer, the watches are your system of interest. Clients use your systems of interest in two ways:

* First, as part of their own system of interest. For instance, a client installs your watch-product in their car-product, then sells the car to their client, and the watch displays the time during the car's use.
* Second, the client uses the watch as part of the creation system for their car product (where the car is the client's product). For example, the client installs your watch-product on the wall of their assembly plant so workers can track time during assembly.

An alternative approach is to trade services instead of system-products. Conceptually, you could send the exact time upon request. While a watch-product may be more suitable for a car or factory than a service like providing precise time upon request, a well-known example of a service is a taxi. You can sell the car-product, or you can offer a transportation service.

To provide a service, you need to create a system that will deliver that service. You don't sell this system; the client pays for the provided service. In the example of a car, it is a product. You can sell the car, so the client serves as the driver and passenger, essentially transporting themselves. Alternatively, you can offer a transportation service, where the client only plays the role of a passenger. Your system, organizing the transportation service, consists at least of a car and a driver, who is your employee.

Typically, services are offered by a creation system, such as a business. A good example is a hotel service, where the hotel provides lodging services.

A service is behavior, work, or a benefit provided by a service-oriented enterprise or system: service equipment, a server, a division, a provider. Notice the difference in terminology?

Let's remind ourselves that we have also referred to system behavior as a function. By nature, function and service do not differ; they are both behaviors of a system (functional or role-based). But why use two different terms?

It's all about different jargon associated with two viewpoints. External project roles use the term "function" when desiring a specific behavior from the supersystem. We say that a system function is designated from outside; it is needed in the supersystem. The term "service" is used by internal project roles who create the system intended to offer a service externally. Whether the offered service becomes the requested function will determine success.

Thus, the term "service" is a perspective from the system toward its environment. Conversely, from the environment/supersystem looking at the system, it is a function. A function might have another name. The service of hammering a nail might be the function of joining boards. The service of drawing water might become the function of anti-freeze circulation.

A function is the system's behavior as seen from the supersystem when clients require a specific function. A service is the system's behavior seen from its developer’s standpoint, saying, "I don't know why it's needed, but I can change certain service aspects of the environment (world)." Alternatively, one can use the term function to observe a system's behavior in a supersystem^[Or a subsystem within a system.] as a functional or role-based entity. The term service is used to examine the behavior of a system in a supersystem as a constructive entity. A service often represents the behavior of a creation system influencing the system of interest.

So, don't be surprised when you hear entirely different discussions about the same subject, product, and its behavior: this reflects varying interests.

Often, clients might say the provided service does not satisfy them, suggesting they expect a particular function, but the service quality does not meet their expectations. For instance, when staying overnight in a hotel, you need to sleep well, wash, etc. This is one assessment—based on needs and functions. On the other hand, from the perspective of the management and other roles that design and manage the hotel, the focus is on the services offered to guests. If the subsystems and the hotel as a whole are poorly designed^[For example, poorly understood audience needs.], complaints about service quality emerge. Clients cannot criticize their own requests (i.e., they don't use the function-based jargon), so they criticize using the language of the management company—saying the service itself^[As we know, the term "service" is used by the creation team.] is poor.

It is crucial to understand that manufacturers and service-oriented companies aim to label their system-products and services so potential buyers immediately see their functional demands reflected. Success in this depends on the market.

Therefore, companies must properly position their services, preventing unintended use by non-target audiences. For instance, if Aisystant offers its current educational services to school students or those seeking easy learning, feedback on low-quality education is inevitable.
