# Conduct Modeling: 5.4. Identify System Levels

Familiarize yourself with the two examples provided in the table. In the third row, the "Product of the Enterprise" is identified as the System of Interest for each example. Above it are the supersystem and super-supersystem, and below it are the subsystems and sub-subsystems for one of the subsystems.

Fill in the empty cells with examples from your work and personal projects, in which you determine the systems of interest (product). Focus on identifying 2 system levels above and below your enterprise's product, in analogy with the given examples.

Find the corresponding assignment number in your modeling workspace and complete all its components.

| Level | Example 1         | Example 2         |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Super-supersystem | [Your Example Here] | [Your Example Here] |
| Supersystem      | [Your Example Here] | [Your Example Here] |
| System of Interest (Product) | [Your Example Here] | [Your Example Here] |
| Subsystem       | [Your Example Here] | [Your Example Here] |
| Sub-subsystem   | [Your Example Here] | [Your Example Here] |
