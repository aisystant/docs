# Project Activities and the Three Main Activity Roles

In the previous section, we focused on the system of interest, treating other systems as auxiliary. However, this does not mean that in project activities, we create or develop only it. In virtually any activity or project, employees[^1] can be part of teams working on various subprojects and be creators of a wide range of systems (our systems and creation systems). For example, Team #1 designs a car engine, while Team #2 focuses on developing the skills of Team #1 members. Team #3 operates the car assembly line, and Team #4 is responsible for creating and developing that assembly line. In all four teams, employees of the automotive corporation, and the same individual can be a member of multiple teams.

To understand the project or all teams and their subprojects within the expanded enterprise, we need to:

* use the simplified meta-meta-model "Table 3x3. Areas of Interest" to consider the project aimed at creating the system of interest, linking various roles and systems;
* introduce additional concepts of "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "system levels."

In the "Table 3x3. Areas of Interest" (hereinafter referred to as Table 3x3) presented below, the connection between the areas of interest of the three main roles (domain areas of roles) and the areas of interest of the three main systems is shown. This tabular representation is a distinct cognitive technique that offers a way to slice the activities of an enterprise (organization). In systems engineering, you will be offered another way to view the creation and development of systems, as well as different role names for situations involving an enterprise, its client base, personality, etc.

In each system's area of interest, there are interests pertaining to all main rolesâ€”the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. Behind these interests are the corresponding roles. The rows of Table 3x3 are areas of interest of the three main systems, while the columns represent areas of interest of the three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

Each cell of Table 3x3 represents a subject of interest for a particular role concerning a specific system. In other words, a role is interested in this system only as it pertains to them. For instance, an entrepreneur interested in the system of interest and everything related to it is called a visionary. Similarly, all other cells in Table 3x3 can be interpreted.
