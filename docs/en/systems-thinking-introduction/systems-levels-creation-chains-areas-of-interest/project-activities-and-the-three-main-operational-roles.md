# Project Activities and Three Main Activity Roles

In the previous section, we focused on the system of interest, while other systems were somewhat auxiliary. However, this doesn't mean that in project activities we create or develop only that system. In practically any activity or project, employees [ ^1 ] can be part of various subproject teams and be creators of a wide range of systems (our systems and creation systems). For example, Team #1 creates a car engine, while another Team #2 develops the skills of Team #1 members. Team #3 works on the car assembly line, and Team #4 deals with the creation and development of this assembly line. All four teams comprise employees of the automotive corporation, and the same person can be a member of multiple teams.

To understand the project or all the teams and subprojects within an expanded enterprise, we need to:

* Use a simplified meta-meta model "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" to consider the project for creating the system of interest, which integrates diverse roles and systems;
* Introduce additional concepts of "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "system levels."

In the "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" below (hereinafter referred to as the 3x3 Table), the relationship between areas of interest for the three main roles (role-related areas) and areas of interest for the three main systems is depicted. This tabular representation is a specific thinking method that offers a way to segment the activities of an enterprise (organization). In systems engineering, you will be provided with another way to look at the creation and development of systems, as well as different role names for scenarios involving enterprises, client bases, personalities, etc.

Within each system's areas of interest, interests of all main roles—entrepreneur, engineer, and manager—are present. These interests are associated with corresponding roles. The rows of the 3x3 Table are the areas of interest of the three main systems, while the columns represent the areas of interest of the three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

Each cell in the 3x3 Table is the subject of interest for a specific role regarding a specific system. This means the role is interested in only what pertains to it within the system. For example, an entrepreneur interested in the system of interest and everything related to it is referred to as a visionary. Similarly, all other cells of the 3x3 Table can be interpreted in this manner.
