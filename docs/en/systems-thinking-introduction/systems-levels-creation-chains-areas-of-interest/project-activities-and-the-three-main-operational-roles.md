title: Project Activities and the Three Main Operational Roles
---

### Previous Section Recap

In the previous section, we focused on the system of interest, with other systems serving as supporting elements. However, this doesn't mean that in project activities we only create or develop the system of interest. In almost any activity or project, employees^[Here referring to individuals as agents or as role performers.] can be part of various subproject teams and be creators of a wide range of systems (our systems and creation systems). For example, Team #1 develops a car engine, while another Team #2 focuses on improving the mastery of Team #1's members. Team #3 works on the car assembly line, and Team #4 is involved in the creation and enhancement of this assembly line. In all four teams, employees of the automotive corporation may work, and the same person can be a member of several teams.

### Understanding Projects and Teams

To make sense of the project and all the teams and their subprojects within the extended enterprise, we need to:

* Use a simplified meta-meta-model called the "3x3 Table of Areas of Interest" to examine the project focused on creating the system of interest, which ties together diverse roles and systems.
* Introduce additional concepts such as "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "system levels."

### 3x3 Table of Areas of Interest

The "3x3 Table of Areas of Interest" (hereafter referred to as the 3x3 Table) illustrates the connection between the areas of interest of three main roles (subject areas of roles) and the areas of interest of three main systems. This tabular representation is an independent thinking tool offering a way to segment the enterprise's (organization's) activities. In systems engineering, you will be introduced to another approach to view the creation and development of systems, along with different names for roles when referring to an enterprise, client base, individual, etc.

In each area of interest of the systems, we have the interests of all main rolesâ€”entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These interests are associated with corresponding roles. The rows in the 3x3 Table represent the areas of interest of three main systems, and the columns represent the areas of interest of three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

### Main Concepts

Each cell in the 3x3 Table represents the subject of interest of a particular role in relation to a particular system. That means the role is not interested in everything about the system, but only in aspects relevant to it. For example, an entrepreneur interested in the system of interest and everything associated with it is called a visionary. The same logic applies to all other cells of the 3x3 Table.
