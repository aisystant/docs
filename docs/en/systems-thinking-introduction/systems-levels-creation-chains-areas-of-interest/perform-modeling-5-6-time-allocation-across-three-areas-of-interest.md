Evaluate how much time you spend working with different areas of interest in the system of interest/engineering, the supersystem/commercial, and the creation systems/organizational/managerial domains. The sum of these percentages in relation to your total time should equal 100 percent.

In your notes, you may outline your plans for future time investment.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all of its points.
