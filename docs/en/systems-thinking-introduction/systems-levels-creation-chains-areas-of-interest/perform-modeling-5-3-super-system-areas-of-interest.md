# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.3. Areas of Supersystem Interest

Review the example of project description across three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your enterprise or project. Use the practice of thinking through writing, and for the first attempt, describe it as best you can. Afterward, edit your description, keeping only the most important parts. You can also revisit the description after some time. As the project develops, remember to update this description, as it is useful for creating all other descriptions and for coordinating teamwork. Formulate notes for further elaboration if necessary. You can also leave feedback for course developers in "Notes."

Locate the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
