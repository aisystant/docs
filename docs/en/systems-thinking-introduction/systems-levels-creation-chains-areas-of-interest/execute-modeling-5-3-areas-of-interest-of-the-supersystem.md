# Execute Modeling: 5.3. Areas of Interest of the Supersystem

Familiarize yourself with an example project description for three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your enterprise or project. Use the practice of thinking through writing, and for the first time, try describing as best as you can. After that, edit it down to only the most essential points. You can also return to the description after some time. As the project develops, don't forget to make changes to this description; it is useful for drafting all other descriptions and for coordinating team work. Make notes for further elaboration as needed. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the “Notes” section.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all of its points.
