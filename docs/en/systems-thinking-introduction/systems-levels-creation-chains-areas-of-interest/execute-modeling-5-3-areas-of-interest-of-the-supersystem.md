# Execute Modeling: 5.3 Areas of Interest of the Supersystem

Familiarize yourself with an example of project description across three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your enterprise or project. Utilize the practice of thinking through writing, and initially attempt to describe it as best as you can. After that, edit to retain only the most important details. You can also revisit the description later. As the project evolves, remember to update this description, as it is useful for compiling all other descriptions and for coordinating team efforts. Create notes for further elaboration as needed. In the "Notes" section, you can also provide feedback for the course developers.

Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.
