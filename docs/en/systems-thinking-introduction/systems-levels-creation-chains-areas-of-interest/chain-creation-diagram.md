title: Chain Creation Diagram

Sometimes it's necessary to logically construct various interconnections to better understand the structure of complex human activities. The main task is to find the place of your system and your team in the creation chain.

Various systems are linked through the stage of exploitation into long creation chains. The diagram shows the stages of three systems. The run-time stage is the stage of exploitation.

These diagrams are useful for narrating stories like:

* We are a startup that will evolve into an IT company. The stages of creating an IT company are depicted on line A.
* The company will produce IT programs for the digital twin of engineered structures, such as bridges. The stages of creating the IT program are depicted on line B.
* Our IT program will be one of the creation systems that designs, builds, and participates in the exploitation of the bridge. The stages of creating the bridge are depicted on line C.

It's crucial for us to extend all reasoning to the system of interestâ€”the bridge. We will have to thoroughly work through this entire chain, and it's not even fully documented here yet! There are more creation systems in this example.

If you do not learn to model and document such chains, each time bringing them to the system of interest, you risk pointlessly discussing what you are doing. However, mastering systems thinking will enable you to develop the skill of unraveling any complex activity by dividing it into creation chains, system levels, systems, stages, and so on.

When you model and document the creation chain, you can easily explain why your project is necessary and how it will lead to the success of the system of interest. The further you are along the creation chain from the system of interest, the more attention you need to devote to working with it. It's quite far from you, and your thinking will require effort to keep it in focus. Teams usually "can't see beyond their noses" and don't want to deal with something so far removed from their immediate activities. However, this mistake costs not only time and resources but also adds stress as it obstructs clarity and structure in project activities.

Using systems thinking, you identify the system of interest, and then design (describe) the entire creation chain up to "your" system, without skipping any system in this chain, and keeping in mind the benefit of your project for the system of interest. This approach will bring clarity and organize your activities, personal life, and work projects.
