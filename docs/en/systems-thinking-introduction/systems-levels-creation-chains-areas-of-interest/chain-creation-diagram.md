# Creation Chain Diagram

Sometimes it's necessary to logically construct different interconnections to better understand how complex human activities are organized. The main goal is to find the place of your system and your team in the creation chain.

Various systems are linked together through the operation stage, forming long creation chains. The diagram illustrates the stages of three systems. The run-time stage is the operation stage.

Such diagrams make it convenient to tell stories like:

* We are a startup that will grow into an IT company. Line A at the top shows the creation stages of the IT company.
* The company will produce an IT program for digital twins of artificial structures, like bridges. Line B illustrates the stages of creating the IT program.
* Our IT program will be one of the creation systems that designs, constructs, and participates in the operation of a bridge. Line C depicts the stages of creating the bridge.

It is important for us to extend all reasoning to the system of interest—the bridge. We will need to thoroughly work through this entire chain. And not all of it is even outlined here! There are more creation systems in this example.

If you do not learn to model and document such chains, bringing them to the system of interest each time, you risk pointlessly discussing what you are doing. However, by mastering systems thinking, you can develop the skill of unraveling any complex activity, dividing it through your focus into creation chains, system levels, systems, stages, and so on.

When you model and document the creation chain, you can easily explain the purpose and necessity of your project and how it will lead to the success of the system of interest. The further you are along the creation chain from the system of interest, the more attention you need to devote to working with it. It is quite far from you, and your thinking requires effort to keep it in focus. Usually, teams "can't see beyond their own noses" and do not want to deal with something so far removed from their immediate activities. However, this mistake costs not only time and resources but also adds stress by hindering clarity and structure in project activities.

Using systems thinking, you identify the system of interest [^1], then design (describe) the entire creation chain up to “your” system [^2], without skipping any system in this chain, and keep the benefits of your project for the system of interest in focus. This approach will bring clarity and order to your activities: personal life and work projects.

[ ^1 ]: Before that, it's also necessary to understand the supersystem, the expected behavior of the system of interest, etc.

[ ^2 ]: If it is indeed somewhere in the creation chain, and not within the system of interest (as a subsystem).
