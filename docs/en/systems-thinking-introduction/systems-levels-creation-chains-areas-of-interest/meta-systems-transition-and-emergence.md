# Meta-system Transition and Emergence

The multi-level nature of system breakdowns is fundamental. At the highest level of any such breakdown, you might find the universe, while at the lowest, there could be superstrings[^1]. However, most people operate at the middle level, with scientists primarily working at the peripheral levels.

For our activities, a small range of system levels is important, corresponding to our life interests. Some might work at the level of humanity or the nano level, but most will be interested in several system levels, similar to those related to a passenger vehicle. For you, this could be an IT program, a bridge, or mastery.

Note: Shifting between system levels changes everythingâ€”including the names of systems, roles, etc. Some roles are involved in using vehicles and discussing who will drive them where, while others examine vehicle parts and consider how to enhance the efficiency of different components. Some roles don't mention the vehicle at all; they simply manufacture standardized parts. Others will focus on the materials used to produce these parts. And so on. This is an intriguing technique of systems thinking that helps tackle any complex subject matter.

All these roles employ various methods and communicate in different languages: for some roles, the language primarily reflects the automobile's environment and the issues related to its use; for others, it involves the production aspects of creating and assembling a car; for others still, it involves issues related to the material's strength, the difficulty of its processing, and so on.

When working with a car, terms like "movement" and "trip" are regularly used, yet the materials from which the car is made are never mentioned. If we shift our attention down one system level, we will talk about engine efficiency. And one level lower? Entirely different people focus on material: its strength, friction, and everything else.

This is all reflected in the language of project roles active at each system level. Transitioning from discussing one system level to another is known as a meta-system transition. For a systems thinker, meta-system transition is literally audible in conversation and visible in text! One technique of systems thinking is the ability to maintain focus in a conversation on the system level being discussed. In professional communication, discussions can cover several system levels simultaneously.

The essence of communication among experienced specialists is not the clever juggling of professional terms but the fluency in meta-system transition. A professional thoroughly understands the emergent property at each system level. For someone with systems thinking, a discussion is not merely a stream of terms; they literally hear or deduce concepts from different system levels and comprehend the connections between different system levels and areas of interest.
