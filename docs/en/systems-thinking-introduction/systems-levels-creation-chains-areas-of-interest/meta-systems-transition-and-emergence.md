# Multilevel Nature of System Breakdown

The multilevel nature of system breakdowns is fundamental. At the very top level of any such breakdown, you potentially have the universe, while at the very bottom—superstrings^[or other known physical objects at the smallest scale.]. However, the vast majority of people operate at the middle level, while scientists predominantly work at the peripheral levels.

For our activities, a narrow range of system levels is important, aligned with our life interests, although some may work at the level of humanity or the nanoscale. Most will be interested in a few system levels similar to those related to an automotive corporation. For you, this might be an IT program, a bridge, or thinking mastery.

**Note**: Shifting between system levels changes everything—including the names of systems, roles, etc. Some roles focus on the use of vehicles and discuss who will drive where. Others consider parts of the vehicle and think about how to improve the efficiency of different parts. A third group makes standardized parts without speaking about the vehicle. A fourth will discuss the materials from which vehicle parts are made. And so forth. This is an interesting technique in systems thinking that helps in dealing with any complex subject area.

All these roles perform various methods and speak different languages: some roles mainly discuss the environment of the vehicle and issues related to its use, others focus on the manufacturing aspects of creation and assembly, and others are concerned with problems related to material strength, processing difficulties, etc.

When working with a passenger vehicle, terms like "movement, trip," etc., are regularly used, but materials from which the vehicle is made are not mentioned at all. If we shift our attention down one system level, we'll be discussing the efficiency of the engine. And what about one level further down? Completely different people focus on materials: strength, friction, and all other aspects.

All this is reflected in the speech of project roles that work at each system level. The transition from discussing one system level to another is known as a meta-system transition. For a systems-oriented thinker, this transition is literally heard in conversation and seen in text! A technique in systems thinking is the ability to keep attention on the system level being discussed. In professional communication, discussions can affect multiple system levels at once.

The main focus in communication among experienced specialists is not the nimble juggling of professional terms, but rather the fluency of meta-system transition. A professional well understands the emergent properties at each system level. For someone using systems thinking, a discussion is not just a flow of terms; they literally hear or read concepts from different system levels and understand the connections between different system levels and areas of interest.
