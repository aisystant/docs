# Meta-system Transition and Emergence

The multi-level nature of system breakdowns is fundamental. At the very top level of any such breakdown, you will potentially find the universe, and at the very bottom, superstrings [ ^1 ]. However, the majority of people operate at the middle levels, while scientists predominantly work at the peripheral levels.

For our activities, a narrow range of system levels is important, one that is commensurate with our life interests, although some might work at the level of humanity or at the nano-level. Most, however, will be concerned with several system levels similar to those associated with an automobile. For you, it might be an IT program, a bridge, or mastery.

Take note: shifting between system levels changes everything â€” including the names of systems, roles, etc. Some roles are involved in using cars, discussing who will drive them and where. Others examine parts of the car and think about how to improve the efficiency of various components. A third group of roles says nothing about the car but simply manufactures standardized parts. A fourth group discusses the materials from which the car parts are made, and so forth. This is an interesting technique of systems thinking that helps navigate any complex subject activity.

All these roles perform various methods and speak different languages: some roles primarily express the car environment and problems associated with its use in their language, while others focus on the production aspects of manufacturing and assembling the car, and yet another focus on issues relating to the material's durability, the difficulty of its processing, and so on.

When working with a car, terms like "movement" and "trip" are regularly used, yet the materials from which the car is made are not mentioned at all. If we shift our attention down one system level, we will talk about engine efficiency. What about one level lower? Completely different people deal with the material: its strength, friction, and everything else.

And all of this is reflected in the communication of project roles working at each system level. Transitioning from discussing one system level to another is known as a meta-system transition. For a systems thinker, a meta-system transition is literally audible in conversation and noticeable in the text! One technique of systems thinking is the ability to maintain focus at the system level being discussed. The fact is that in professional communication, a discussion may simultaneously touch on several system levels.

The key to communication among experienced specialists is not the skillful juggling of professional terms but the fluency in meta-system transitions. A professional has a good understanding of emergent properties at every system level. For someone with systems thinking, a discussion is not merely a stream of terms; they can literally hear or read concepts from different system levels and understand the connection between various levels and areas of interest.
