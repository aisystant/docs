# Systems Approach 3.0

In the first generation of systems thinking, systems were considered "objective" rather than subjective, meaning that multiple stakeholders were not taken into account. For example, a chair, a hammer, or a car are systems that everyone can understand, with a clear purpose (role and function), and only this was considered. Such clarity allowed for formal modeling of only the most critical elements within systems^[Without giving due attention to the large number of other interests and interactions.], and so first-generation systems thinking textbooks are filled with formulas, numbers, etc.

At the end of the last century and in the 2010s, the second generation of systems thinking prevailed, differing from its predecessor by considering systems as subjective rather than objective. Numerous stakeholders emerged, along with the understanding that systems do not exist independently but come into being when needed by someone. Recall the earlier discussion in Section 2 about the "hammer" system and how it differs from the physical object called a "hammer." Additionally, in the first generation, systems seemed to create themselves, while in the second, they are made by people.

In the 2020s, a noticeable number of works emerged that can be attributed to the third generation of systems thinking. Our intellect stack also relies on these modern trends and develops them further. The main principles of the third generation are:

* Scalability, meaning a consistent approach and reasoning for objects of all sizes, from tiny details to entire systems or from superstrings to the universe;
* De-anthropomorphism, meaning not elevating humans as something obligatory, thus we speak of agents with varying consciousness, memory, modeling ability, and computational power for planning actions;
* Multilevel evolution, meaning not only focusing on genes but also memes, and overcoming numerous problems and misalignments between system levels, with ethics coming into play in decision-making;
* Continuous development^[Especially applied in systems engineering and explored in detail in the relevant course. This principle includes advanced generative modeling, good documentation, configuration management, and system modularity. Development is incremental with small and rapid changes to adapt to constantly changing conditions. The main goal of continuous development is long-term success and the retention of achieved results.], meaning the development of a system (product) never ends and continuously adapts, considering changes in the surroundings at different system levels and issues that arise during the development process (including the organization of development).

The third generation of the systems approach considers a scalable world of systems, not a "world of people," where these systems are continuously developing and always in process. In this process of development (and sometimes destruction), misalignments (frustrations) between system levels are involved, and conflicts between all levels (systemic and creation chains) occur.

Systems at different system levels strive to maintain stability and develop, but this contradicts the desires for stability and development of systems at the same or other system levels. For example, countries may go to war with each other or break apart internally due to disagreements at the level of individual communities and interest groups. Also, quite often during evolution, meta-system transitions occur, and this happens due to inevitable misalignments between system levels. As a result, only certain system configurations survive, which most accurately resolve the problem of multilevel (and not single-level!) optimization.

It is important to note that the principles of the third-generation systems approach can be discussed considering the concepts introduced in this section. For example, it's impossible to consider only one system level^[This is fraught with a fatal error.], requiring collaboration with other teams working at other system levels. Successful systems are those where satisfying interests (optimizing conflicts and misalignments) occurs immediately between different levels, even those we are unaware of. At the very least, one must always strive to learn about all misalignments.

You will study the third generation of systems thinking in more detail in the "Systems Thinking" course.
