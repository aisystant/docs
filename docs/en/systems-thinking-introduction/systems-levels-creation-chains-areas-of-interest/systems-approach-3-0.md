# Systems Approach 3.0

In the first generation of systems thinking, systems were considered "objective," meaning they were viewed without accounting for numerous stakeholders. For instance, a chair, hammer, or car were understood as systems with a clear purpose (role and function), and only that was taken into account. This clarity allowed the formal modeling of systems to focus solely on the most essential elements,^[Neglecting the significant number of other interests and interactions.] and therefore, the textbooks of the first generation of systems thinking were filled with formulas, numbers, and so forth.

In the late 20th century and the 2010s, the second generation of systems thinking prevailed, differing from its predecessor by considering systems not as objective but as subjective. Numerous stakeholders emerged, along with the understanding that systems do not exist on their own but arise when someone needs them. Recall how we previously discussed in Section 2 the system "hammer" and its distinction from the physical object we call a "hammer." Additionally, in the first generation, systems were thought to create themselves, whereas, in the second, they are made by people.

In the 2020s, a noticeable number of works emerged that can be associated with the third generation of systems thinking. Our intellect stack also relies on these modern trends and develops them further. The main principles of the third generation include:

* **Scalelessness:** An identical approach and reasoning for objects of all scales, from tiny details to entire systems, or from superstrings to the universe;
* **De-anthropomorphism:** Avoiding the elevation of humans as mandatory elements, hence we talk about agents with varying levels of consciousness, memory, modeling ability, and computational power for action planning;
* **Multilevel Evolution:** This refers not only to genes but also to memes, as well as overcoming numerous problems and misalignments between system levels, leading to ethical considerations in decision-making;
* **Continuous Development:**^[Especially applied in systems engineering and elaborated in the respective course. This principle includes advanced generative modeling, good documentation, configuration management, and system modularity. Development occurs incrementally with small, rapid changes to adapt to ever-changing conditions. The main goal of continuous development is long-term success and maintaining achieved results.] This means the development of a system (product) never ends, continuously adapting to changes in the surroundings at different system levels and addressing problems that arise during development (including in the organization of development).

The third generation of the systems approach considers a scaleless world of systems instead of a "world of humans," and these systems are continually evolving and are always in process. In this developmental (and sometimes destructive) process, misalignments (frustrations) between system levels are involved, and conflicts transpire between all levels (systemic and creation chains).

Systems at different system levels attempt to maintain stability and grow, but this conflicts with the desires for stability and growth of systems at the same or other system levels. For example, countries may wage war against each other or collapse internally due to disagreements at the level of individual communities and interest groups. Moreover, during evolution, meta-systemic transitions frequently occur due to inevitable misalignments between system levels. Consequently, only certain system configurations survive, those optimized for multilevel (not single-level!) optimization.

Note that these principles of the third generation system approach can be discussed considering the concepts introduced in this section. For instance, it is impossible to examine only one system level,^[This is fraught with obvious mistakes.] as collaboration with other teams working at different system levels is often necessary. Successful systems are those where the satisfaction of interests (optimization of conflicts and misalignments) occurs across various levels, even those we are unaware of. At the very least, it is crucial to always try to learn about all misalignments.

You will study the third generation of systems thinking in more detail in the "Systems Thinking" course.
