# Systems Approach 3.0

In the first generation of systems thinking, systems were considered "objective" rather than subjective, meaning they did not account for numerous stakeholders. For example, a chair, a hammer, or a car are systems understood by everyone, with a clear purpose (role and function), and only that was considered. This clarity allowed for formal modeling of only the most important aspects in systems^[Without paying due attention to a large number of other interests and interactions.], and therefore, textbooks from the first generation of systems thinking are full of formulas, numbers, etc.

Towards the end of the last century and in the 2010s, the second generation of systems thinking predominated, which differed from its predecessor by considering systems as subjective rather than objective. Numerous stakeholders emerged. There was an understanding that systems do not exist independently but come into being when necessary for someone. Recall when we discussed the "hammer" system and its distinction from the physical object called "hammer" in Section 2. Moreover, in the first generation, systems were created as if on their own, while in the second, they are made by people.

In the 2020s, a noticeable number of works began to emerge that can be associated with the third generation of systems thinking. Our intellect stack also relies on these modern trends and develops them. The main principles of the third generation are:

* Scalelessness, meaning the same approach and reasoning apply to objects of various scales, from tiny details to entire systems or from superstrings to the universe;
* De-anthropomorphism, meaning not emphasizing humans as obligatory elements, hence we talk about agents with varying degrees of consciousness, memory, and an ability to model, as well as possessing different computational capabilities for planning actions;
* Multi-level evolution, which involves not only genes but also memes, as well as overcoming numerous problems and misalignments between system levels, leading to ethics in decision-making;
* Continuous development^[Particularly applied in systems engineering and elaborated in the relevant course. This principle includes advanced generative modeling, good system documentation, configuration management, and modularity. Development is incremental, with small and rapid changes to adapt to ever-changing conditions. The main goal of continuous development is long-term success and retention of achieved results.], meaning the development of a system (product) never ends and continues constantly, considering changes in the surroundings across different system levels and issues arising during development (including in the organization of development).

In the third generation of the systems approach, a scaleless world of systems is considered, not a "world of people," and these systems are continuously developing and are always in process. In this process of development (and sometimes destruction), misalignments (frustrations) between system levels are involved, and conflicts occur across all levels (system levels and creation chains).

Systems at different system levels strive to maintain stability and develop, but this conflicts with the desires for stability and development of systems at the same or other system levels. For example, countries may go to war with one another or fall apart internally due to disagreements at the level of individual communities and interest groups. Meta-system transitions also frequently occur during evolution because of inevitable misalignments between system levels. As a result, only some configurations of systems survive, specifically those that accurately solve the problem of multi-level (as opposed to single-level) optimization.

Note that these principles of the third-generation systems approach can be discussed considering the concepts introduced in this section. For instance, it is impossible to consider only one system level^[This is fraught with fatal error.]; cooperation with other teams working on different system levels becomes necessary. Successful systems are those where the satisfaction of interests (the optimization of conflicts and misalignments) occurs across different levels, even those we are unaware of. At the very least, it is always crucial to try to learn about all misalignments.

You will study the third generation of systems thinking in more detail in the course "Systems Thinking."
