# Creation Chain

Another important term related to the three main types of systems is the creation chain. This term is more closely associated with the creator or creation systems.

Let's continue exploring the system of interest: a car. One of its creation systems would be an automobile factory. To build the factory, another creation system is needed, namely the car factory's creation system. This results in lengthy chains.

For systems like a car or a bridge, such chains are often intuitive for many people. However, in the case of software, they can be much longer and more complex because software needs to connect to the physical world, meaning it must find how it's related to some system of interest. Software is rarely created for its own sake; it always serves a purpose within a system in the physical world.

Imagine, for example, any of the numerous software projects involved in a car's creation. Why do they exist? What's the purpose of all this software? Ultimately, it's to produce the car! Systems thinking requires tracing the entire chain from an IT program used in a creation project all the way to the car itself.
