# Creation Chain

Another crucial term, which is associated with the three main types of systems, is the creation chain. This term is more connected with the creator or creation systems.

Let's continue examining the system of interest, a car. One of its creation systems would be a car factory. To build the factory, another creation system is required, which would be the factory's creation system. This results in long chains.

In the case of systems like a car or a bridge, such chains are usually intuitive for many. However, in the case of software, they can be much longer and more complex. This is because software needs to reach into the physical world, i.e., find how the software is linked to a certain system of interest. Software is rarely created without purpose; it always connects to a system in the physical world.

Imagine, for example, any of the programming projects involved in the creation of a car. Why do they exist? Why all this software? To ultimately result in the appearance of a car! Systems thinking demands tracking the entire chain from the IT program used in the creation project to the car itself.
