title: Chain of Creation
---

Another important term associated with the three main types of systems is the **creation chain**. This term is more closely related to the creator or the creation systems.

Let's continue examining the system of interest: the automobile. One of its creation systems would be the automotive factory. To build the factory, another creation system is necessary, which would be the creation system for the automotive factory. This leads to lengthy chains.

In the case of systems like automobiles or bridges, such chains are often intuitively clear to many. However, in the case of software, they can be much longer and more complex. This complexity arises because software must interface with the physical world, finding how it connects to a system of interest. Software is rarely created in isolationâ€”it always ties to some system in the physical world.

Consider, for example, any of the many programming projects involved in automobile creation. Why do they exist? Why is all this software necessary? Ultimately, it's so that an automobile emerges! **Systems thinking** demands tracking the entire chain from the IT program used in the creation project to the automobile itself.
