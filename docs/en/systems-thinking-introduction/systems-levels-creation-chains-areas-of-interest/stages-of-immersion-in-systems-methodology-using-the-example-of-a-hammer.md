# Stages of Immersion in Systems Methodology Using the Example of a "Hammer"

Let's explore the progress in learning systems thinking, continuing with our previous example of a hammer discussed in earlier sections.

In student culture, there are jokes about how university students think, where seniors know more about life than freshmen. A similar dynamic is observed at Aisystant, with the instructor's question to a student: "Give an example of a physical object." Your answer to this question reflects the depth of your understanding of systems thinking.

A student in the preparatory course "Systems Self-Development" might answer the question about a physical object with "a hammer." This answer would be accepted. In the preparatory courses at AISYSTANT, the primary focus is on distinguishing between the physical world and the mental space. This is important to separate concepts like "age," "freedom," "love," or "theory" from objects such as "hammer," "textbook," or "shorts."

A student of the "Rational Work" course or someone with solid ontological mastery^[It's not required to complete the "Rational Work" course for this, but it is extremely beneficial for developing ontological thinking, which is essential for systems thinking.] would not answer like a preparatory program student. They understand that the word "hammer" can refer to an instance of the "Carpentry Tools" class. Therefore, it's not enough to simply say "a hammer." A correct response would be: "this large hammer in your hand." It's necessary to clearly define the context, making it clear that we are talking about a specific physical object, not an ideal abstract object (an instance of some class).

A student studying systems thinking would go furtherâ€”they can reason not just about a physical object but about the "hammer" system. They understand that the word "hammer" can signify different things in different contexts: an instance of a class, a specific physical object, and a system. In the latter case, the "hammer" system could be "this stone in my hand."

This is akin to the well-known phrase: "Will Will will Will will Will's will?"^[In English, this sounds like "Will Will will Will will Will's will." It also involves different types: agent, document, action.]. The word "hammer" is singular, but it can signify very different types, and one must consciously understand this. While such distinctions might go unnoticed in everyday life, lacking this skill can make it challenging to succeed in complex work projects.

The demonstrated gradual immersion into a complex methodology using the hammer example is customary in the learning culture. Children first learn about numbers, then natural numbers, and then integers, rational, real, and ultimately, as students, they study complex numbers^[And some early learning answers need to be corrected as a result of deeper immersion into the methodology.]. Our educational trajectory for mastering complex systems thinking is constructed similarly.

A person studying systems thinking masters general techniques for thinking about systems, understands different types of systems, and can distinguish Systems Approach 3.0 from previous generations. In the following courses of the main "Organizational Development" program, you will learn specific principles for working with different types of systems, such as an individual, an enterprise, an IT system, or an automobile.
