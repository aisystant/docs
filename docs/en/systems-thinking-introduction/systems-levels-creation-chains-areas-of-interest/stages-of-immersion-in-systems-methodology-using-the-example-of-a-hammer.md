# Stages of Immersion into Systems Methodology Using the "Hammer" Example

Let's explore the progression of learning systems thinking, continuing with our example of the hammer discussed in previous sections.

In student culture, there are jokes about how university students think, where senior students know more about life than freshmen. Similarly, at Aisystant, there's this dynamic with the teacher's question to the student: "Give an example of a physical object." How you answer this question can indicate the depth of your immersion in systems thinking.

A student in the preparatory course "Systems Self-Development" would answer this question about a physical object with—"a hammer." And this answer would be accepted. In the preparatory courses at AISYSTANT, the focus is firstly on distinguishing between the physical world and the mental space. It's crucial to separate "age," "freedom," "love," or "theory" from objects like "hammer," "textbook," or "shorts."

A student in the course "Rational Work" or someone with solid ontological mastery^[It is not mandatory to take the "Rational Work" course for this, but it is extremely beneficial for developing ontological thinking, without which systems thinking cannot be established.] cannot answer like a preparatory program student. They understand that the word "hammer" could denote an instance of the class "Carpentry Tools." Thus, merely saying "hammer" is insufficient. A correct answer would be: "this large hammer in your hand." It is essential to clearly define the context from which it is understood that it refers to a specific physical object rather than an ideal abstract object (an instance of some class).

A student studying systems thinking goes further—they can not only discuss a physical object but also the "hammer" system. They understand that the word "hammer" can mean different things in different contexts: an instance of a class, a concrete physical object, and a system. In the latter case, the "hammer" system could be this "stone in my hand."

This realization is like the well-known phrase: "Will Will will Will will Will's will?"^[In English, this phrase demonstrates different types: agent, document, action.]. The word "hammer" is one, but it can denote entirely different types, and one must consciously understand these distinctions. While such distinctions might not attract attention in everyday life, in complex work projects, lacking such a skill makes success challenging.

The gradual immersion into a complex methodology using the hammer example is accepted in the learning culture. Thus, children first learn about numbers, then natural numbers, followed by whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, and ultimately as students, they study complex numbers^[And some early learning answers have to be corrected as a result of deeper immersion into the methodology.]. We similarly structure our trajectory of learning complex systems thinking.

A person studying systems thinking is adept with general tools for thinking about systems, understands different types of systems, and grasps how systems approach 3.0 differs from previous generations. In the subsequent courses of the core program "Organizational Development," you will learn specific principles for working with different types of systems, such as personalities, enterprises, IT systems, or automobiles.
