# Stages of Immersion in Systems Methodology Using the Example of a "Hammer" 

Let's explore the progression of learning systems thinking by continuing with our example of a hammer, as discussed in previous sections.

In student culture, there are anecdotes about how university students think, with senior students knowing more about life than freshmen. The same dynamic is observed at Aisystant, with the instructor's question to a student: "Give an example of a physical object." How you answer this question can reflect the depth of your immersion in systems thinking.

A student in the preliminary course "Systems Self-Development" would answer the question about a physical object with—"a hammer." This answer would be accepted. In preliminary courses at Aisystant, the primary focus is on distinguishing the physical world from the mental space. This distinction is crucial so that "age," "freedom," "love," or "theory" are separated from objects like "hammer," "textbook," or "shorts."

A student of the "Rational Work" course, or a person with good ontological mastery^[It is not mandatory to take the "Rational Work" course, but it is extremely beneficial for developing ontological thinking, without which systems thinking cannot be established.] cannot respond like a student from the preliminary program. They recognize that the term "hammer" might denote an instance of the class "Carpentry Tools." Therefore, one cannot simply say—"hammer." The correct response would be: "this particular large hammer in your hand." In other words, it is necessary to clearly define the context, which clarifies that we are speaking about a specific physical object, rather than an ideal abstract object (an instance of some class).

A student studying systems thinking goes further—they are able to reason not just about a physical object, but about the "hammer" system. They understand that the word "hammer" can signify different things in various contexts. For instance, an instance of a class, a specific physical object, and a system. In the latter case, the "hammer" system might be represented by this "stone in my hand."

It's like the well-known phrase: "Will Will will Will will Will's will?"^[In English, it can appear this way: "Will Will will Will will Will's will?" Here, too, there are different types: agent, document, action.]. The word "hammer" is one, but it can denote entirely different types, and this must be consciously managed. While in everyday life such a lack of differentiation between types might not attract attention, in complex projects, this skill is crucial for success.

Demonstrated gradual immersion in a complex methodology using the example of a hammer is a recognized approach in educational culture. Thus, children first learn about numbers, then natural numbers, followed by whole numbers, rational numbers, real numbers, and eventually, as university students, they study complex numbers^[And some answers from early learning need to be adjusted based on deeper immersion in methodology.]. Similarly, we build our trajectory for teaching complex systems thinking.

A practitioner of systems thinking masters general techniques for thinking about systems, understands different kinds of systems, and differentiates the systems approach 3.0 from previous generations. In subsequent core program courses, "Organizational Development," you will learn specific principles of working with various types of systems, such as individual, enterprise, IT system, or vehicle.
