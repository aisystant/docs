# Perform Modeling: 5.1. Concepts

List the five or more concepts from this section that you remember the most, and next to them, indicate the concepts with which they are most strongly connected for you. Other concepts can come from your current worldviews, meaning it's not necessary to include only the core concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or those close to you. For example, you can try to explain these concepts in simple language, provide examples from your experience, connect different concepts together, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.
