These additional concepts can stem from your current worldviews; thus, you are not restricted to mentioning only the primary concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with your peers, colleagues, or close contacts. As an approach, consider explaining these concepts in simple language, sharing examples from your experience, linking different concepts together, or illustrating their importance.
