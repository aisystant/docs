# Perform Modeling: 5.2. Annotating with Types Using Notation ::

Review the example in the first row of the table. Use the most convenient method for marking types in the textâ€”the double colon "::". First, write the name of the object, followed by its type from the meta-model (or also from the meta-meta-model if needed). For example: "an airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object". If necessary, revisit the theoretical material on :: notation in the "Rational Work" course.

For the sentences from the table, create a duplicate by indicating the types of all objects and relationships, as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and write a few examples from work and personal projects.

In your modeling workspace, find the corresponding assignment by number and complete all its points.
