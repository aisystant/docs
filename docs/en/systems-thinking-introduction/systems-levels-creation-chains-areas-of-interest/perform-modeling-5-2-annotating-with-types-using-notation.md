**Familiarize Yourself with the Example in the First Row of the Table**

Use the most convenient type markup option in the textâ€”double colons "::". First, write the object's name, then its type from the meta-model (or additionally from the meta-meta-model). For example: "airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object". If necessary, review the theoretical material on notation :: in the course "Rational Work".

**For sentences from the table, create a duplicate, specifying the types of all objects and relationships, as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and provide several examples from work and personal projects.**

Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
