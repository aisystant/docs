# Conclusions of the Section and Key Concepts

Areas of interest consist of numerous related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas are focal points for all project roles, and given the multitude of subjects, they can be grouped into designated areas to ease working with them. We identify the areas of interest for the supersystem, the system of interest, and the creation systems, as well as the subject areas of interest for the roles of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

Levels in the system breakdown hierarchy are referred to as system levels. At each level, the system constructor observes their roles, methods, systems, concepts, and so forth.

Creation chains are creation systems that plan, develop, and dispose of other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the technique of distinguishing between all the concepts covered in this section. However, applying these concepts to your project may not come easily at first. Gaining experience through executing multiple projects is essential.

Key concepts: areas of interest, area of interest for the supersystem, system of interest, creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager; model, activity roles; system breakdown, system levels, meta-system transition, emergence; creation chain; misalignments, systems approach 3.0, scale-independence, de-anthropomorphism, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
