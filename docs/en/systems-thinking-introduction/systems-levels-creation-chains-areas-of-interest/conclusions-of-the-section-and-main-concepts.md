# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

**Areas of Interest**

Areas of interest are a set of related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas are the focal points for all roles in a project. Since there are quite a few subjects of interest, they can be grouped into specific areas for easier management. We identify areas of interest for the supersystem, the system of interest, and creation systems, as well as subject areas of interest for the roles of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

System levels in the hierarchy of system breakdowns are called system levels. At each level, a system constructor recognizes the roles, methods, systems, concepts, and more that pertain to it.

**Creation Chains**

Creation chains are creation systems that plan, create, and dispose of other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the skill of distinguishing all the concepts covered in this section. However, it may take some time to apply these concepts to your own project. This requires the experience of implementing several projects.

**Main Concepts:** areas of interest, the area of interest of the supersystem, the system of interest, the creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager; model, activity roles; system breakdown, system levels, meta-system transition, emergence; creation chain; misalignments, Systems Approach 3.0, scalelessness, de-anthropomorphism, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
