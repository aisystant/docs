# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

Areas of interest consist of several related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas are the focus for all roles in a project, and since there are quite a few subjects of interest, it's convenient to group them into specific areas. We distinguish areas of interest for the supersystem, the system of interest, and the creation systems, as well as the subject areas of interest for the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

Levels in the hierarchy of system breakdowns are called system levels. At each level, the system constructor sees roles, methods, systems, concepts, etc.

Creation chains are creation systems that plan, create, and recycle other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the technique of distinguishing all the concepts covered in this section. However, applying these concepts to your own project may not come immediately. This requires experience in implementing several projects.

Key concepts: areas of interest, area of interest of the supersystem, system of interest, creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, model, activity roles; system breakdown, system levels, meta-system transition, emergence; creation chain; misalignments, systems approach 3.0, scalability, de-anthropomorphization, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
