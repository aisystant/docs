# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.2. Annotating Types Using :: Notation

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Use the most convenient formatting option for annotating types in the text â€” the double colon "::". First, write the name of the object, then its type from the meta-model (or additionally from the meta-meta-model). For example: "an airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object". If necessary, review the theoretical material on :: notation in the "Rational Work" course.

For the sentences in the table, make a duplicate, indicating the types of all objects and relationships, as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and write several examples from work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding task in your modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.
