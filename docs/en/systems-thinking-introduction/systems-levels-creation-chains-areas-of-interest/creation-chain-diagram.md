# Creation Chain Diagram

At times, it's necessary to logically construct different relationships to better understand the complexity of human activities. The key goal is to determine the place of your system and your team within the creation chain.

Various systems are interconnected through the operational stage in long creation chains. The picture displays the stages of three systems. The run-time stage represents the operational stage.

Diagrams like these are useful for telling stories, such as:

* We are a startup aspiring to become an IT company. Line A at the top shows the creation stages of an IT company.
* The company will develop an IT program for creating digital twins of artificial structures, such as bridges. Line B illustrates the stages of creating the IT program.
* Our IT program will be one of the creation systems that designs, constructs, and participates in the operation of the bridge. Line C shows the stages of creating a bridge.

It is crucial for us to extend all our reasoning to the system of interestâ€”the bridge. We will need to meticulously work through this entire chain, which is not yet fully detailed here! In this example, there are even more creation systems.

If you do not learn to model and document such chains, fully extending them to the system of interest every time, you risk engaging in meaningless discussions about what you are doing. However, by mastering systems thinking, you can develop the skill of unraveling any complex activity, dividing it with your focus into creation chains, system levels, systems, stages, and more.

If you model and document the creation chain, you can easily explain the purpose and significance of your project and how it will lead to the success of the system of interest. The further you are along the creation chain from the system of interest, the more attention you need to devote to working with it. It is quite distant from you, and maintaining your focus on it will require effort. Teams usually "cannot see beyond their noses," and they are often reluctant to engage with something so far removed from their immediate activities. However, this mistake not only wastes time and resources but also adds stress by hindering clarity and structure in project activities.

Using systems thinking, you identify the system of interest [ ^1 ], and then design (describe) the entire creation chain leading to "your" system [ ^2 ], without skipping any system in this chain and keeping in mind the benefits of your project to the system of interest. This approach will bring clarity and order to your activities: both in personal life and work projects.

[ ^1 ]: First, it is necessary to understand the supersystem, the expected behavior of the system of interest, etc.

[ ^2 ]: If it is indeed somewhere in the creation chain and not within the system of interest (as a subsystem).
