# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.1. Concepts

List five or more memorable concepts from this section, and alongside each, identify concepts that you associate most closely with them. These related concepts may come from your current worldview, meaning you don't have to list only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, you could try explaining these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
