# Areas of Interest for Entrepreneurs, Engineers, and Managers

Let's take a closer look at three key areas of interest and discuss the interests of the three main roles—entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are demarcated as activity roles, which are widely recognized in culture (there are textbooks written about them, and they are relatively easy to identify) and can be used to explain other roles (serving as a meta-model for other roles).

For instance, you may be well-versed in medicine and familiar with many roles within the "doctors" category. An adult typically has a reasonable activity awareness of medicine. However, if you aim to build successful systems and/or pursue career growth, you also need to understand the roles and work artifacts of entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers. In fact, the role of a physician can be interpreted through these three principal roles. For example, the role of a dentist represents an engineer's role in the project of dental treatment, while a chief physician is a position where one is likely to perform the role of a manager among others.

The three areas of interest of these roles constitute the minimal professional (activity-based) awareness for a modern individual. Whatever position you hold or roles you perform, it is essential to understand the subjects of interest for entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers at a general level in a specific project or organization.

This awareness is vital for everyone because, in some way or another, we all assume the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, at least in personal projects. Questions like where to study or invest time, how to become a constructor for oneself or a child, and how to manage resources are regularly addressed by everyone.

Let's revisit the 3x3 Table and examine it through the lens of the three primary roles. Notice, for example, that a cook in a soup-making project acts in the activity-role of an engineer, but their area of interest is not limited to the soup system since they may be interested in the presentation of the dish, the kitchen setup, ingredients, utensils, and more. Thus, an engineer is interested not only in the system of interest but also in others. From this, we can deduce general descriptions of areas of interest, roles, and work artifacts for each cell in the table.

Entrepreneurs are interested in how to profit by addressing people's dissatisfactions and making it a continuous endeavor (both now and in the future). The "entrepreneurs" category encompasses interests and corresponding roles:

* Promoter (including educator, marketer, seller) — an entrepreneur interested in the external environment (market, opportunities) or the supersystem, including the client base and their dissatisfactions;
* Visionary (strategist) — an entrepreneur concerned with the demand (profitable sales) of a specific system of interest now and in the future;
* Businessman (founder) — an entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the system of interest.

Engineers are concerned with the system of interest, which should make the world a better place. The "engineers" category includes interests and corresponding roles:

* Product Owner — an engineer interested in modeling and documenting the use cases of the system of interest within the supersystem;
* Engineer of the System of Interest — an engineer focused on creating a successful system of interest (in one instance), taking into account all stakeholders. Roles in the "engineers" category may include architects and developers;
* Development Organizer (DevOps, platform technology engineer, methods manager) — an engineer concerned with the functional capability of the enterprise (creation systems) to produce the system of interest, including the required quantity.

Managers focus on creation systems, which must produce systems of interest in necessary quantities (not just one):

* Relations Manager (PR, GR, and others) — a manager interested in the consideration of external stakeholders relative to the enterprise, including the company's image and managing communications with various interested parties, such as investors and the public;
* Operational Manager — a manager interested in creating and delivering the system of interest on-time and within budget. They organize the existing personnel to perform the assigned roles in a pre-arranged enterprise;
* Administrator — a manager interested in the functionality and readiness for work of all enterprise systems, including qualified personnel, necessary resources (turnover), and operational tools (technology).

The team's workflow can be described as follows:

1. Initially, the entrepreneur identifies a group of potential clients and their problems (target group). Next, they understand how these problems can be solved, designating a possible system of interest, and also secure resources for organizing business operations;
2. Then, a systems engineer^[In roles like developer, architect, etc.] gets involved, identifying the needs of project roles and devising the setup of the system of interest to resolve problems for the identified group of consumers;
3. Finally, a manager establishes and oversees the enterprise, which should release the required quantity of the system of interest to address the issues of the target consumer group, while informing all external project roles about how their interests are considered.

Regardless of your role or position, it is advisable to understand the systems' areas of interest and the specific areas of the three key roles. It's necessary to manage your attention by thinking about all these topics together and, when required, separately.
