# Areas of Interest of the Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Manager

Let's delve deeper into three areas of interest and discuss the interests of three main roles—entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are what we call activity-based roles, which are culturally recognized (textbooks are written on them, and they are relatively easy to distinguish) and through which other roles can be explained (serving as a meta-model for other roles).

For example, you may be well-versed in medicine and familiar with many roles within the "doctors" category. An adult typically possesses a decent professional understanding of medicine. However, if you aim to create successful systems and/or pursue career advancement, you also need to understand the roles and work artifacts of entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers. Similarly, the role of a doctor can also be explained through these three main roles. For instance, the role of a dentist is an engineering role in the project of treating teeth, while the chief physician is a position likely to include performing managerial duties among others.

The interests of these roles represent the minimal professional scope of a modern individual. Regardless of your position or the roles you perform, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the interests of entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers in a specific project or enterprise.

This understanding is crucial for everyone since we all play the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager at least in personal projects. Where to study or invest time, how to develop oneself or one's child into a constructive professional, and how to manage resources? Every person regularly addresses these questions.

Let's revisit Table 3x3 and examine it through the lens of the three main roles. Note that, for example, a chef in the project of cooking soup assumes the activity-based role of an engineer. However, their domain is not limited to the soup system, as they may be interested in serving the dish to the diner, the kitchen space, ingredients, tableware, etc. Thus, the engineer is interested in not just the system of interest but other systems as well. Based on this, we can outline general descriptions of interests, roles, and work artifacts for each cell in the table.

Entrepreneurs are interested in continuously (now and in the future) earning by addressing people's dissatisfactions. The "entrepreneurs" category includes interests and corresponding roles:

* Promoter (including educator, marketer, sales representative) — An entrepreneur interested in the external environment (market, opportunities) or the supersystem including the client base and its dissatisfactions.
* Visionary (strategist) — An entrepreneur interested in the demand (profitability of sales) of a specific system of interest now and in the future.
* Businessman (founder) — An entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the system of interest.

Engineers are interested in the system of interest, which should change the world for the better. The "engineers" category includes interests and corresponding roles:

* Product Owner — An engineer interested in modeling and documenting use cases of the system of interest within the supersystem.
* Engineer of the System of Interest — An engineer focused on creating a successful system of interest (in a single instance), considering all stakeholders. Roles could include architects and developers.
* Development Organizer (DevOps, development platform technologist, method manager) — An engineer interested in the enterprise's functional capability (creation systems) to produce the system of interest, including the required quantity.

Managers are focused on creation systems that must produce the system of interest in the necessary quantity (not just one):

* Manager of External Relations (PR, GR, and others) — A manager concerned with the external stakeholders of the enterprise, including its image and communication management with various stakeholders, such as investors and the public.
* Operational Manager — A manager or supervisor focused on the creation and timely release of the system of interest within budget constraints. They organize existing personnel to perform relevant roles on the pre-designed enterprise.
* Administrator — A manager interested in the operational readiness and functioning of all enterprise systems, including qualified personnel, necessary resources (turnover), and functioning tools (technologies).

The team's workflow can be explained as follows:

1. First, the entrepreneur identifies a group of potential clients and their problems (target group). They then determine how to solve these problems and designate a potential system of interest. They also find resources to organize business activities;
2. Next, a systems engineer^[Roles include developer, architect, etc.] identifies the needs of project roles and designs the system of interest, which should solve the problems identified by the entrepreneur for the target consumer group;
3. Afterward, the manager creates and runs the enterprise that should produce the required quantity of the system of interest to resolve the problems of the target consumer group. They also inform all external project roles about how their interests are considered.

Regardless of your role or position, it is beneficial to understand the areas of interest in systems and the subject areas of the three main roles. You need to be able to think about all these aspects both together and separately, managing your attention as necessary.
