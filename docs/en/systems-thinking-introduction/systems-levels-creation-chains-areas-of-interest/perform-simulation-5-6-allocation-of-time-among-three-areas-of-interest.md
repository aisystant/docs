# Complete the modeling exercise: 5.6. Time Allocation Across Three Areas of Interest

Estimate how much time you spend working on different areas of interest: the system of interest/engineering, supersystem/commercial, and the creation systems/organizational/managerial. The total should sum up to 100 percent of your overall time.

In the notes, you may describe your future plans for investing your time.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
