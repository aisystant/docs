# System Breakdown

We have explored the areas of interest, and now let's discuss system breakdown and system levels. It's important not to confuse the ideas of "areas of interest" (of systems and roles) and "system levels."

As you already know, systems can be viewed from different perspectives:

* when a system is whole for certain parts within it, meaning the entire system consists of subsystems;
* when a system is a part of a supersystem, meaning the system itself acts as a subsystem.

Each subsystem is also a whole for its sub-subsystems, and each supersystem is a part of a super-supersystem. Thus, we can speak of system breakdown from top to bottom or from bottom to top. If we do not currently plan to break down a system further, it is termed a "system element," emphasizing that there is an entire system for which this subsystem is an element.

Levels in the system breakdown are called system levels. They are distinguished by focusing attention using the part-whole relationship. With its help, we logically highlight these levels in the physical world. Of course, there are no special level-boundaries in the physical world; a systems thinker identifies them through focused attention.

The classic breakdown into system levels originated from biology. The illustration shows that cells consist of molecules, yet cells themselves are part of organs. Organs consist of cells, but organs are components of organisms. And so forth. A person in the specific role of a biologist decided to divide the world into parts in this manner and found corresponding names for these parts and levels[^1].

The illustration shows system levels—the level of organisms, organs, cells, and the molecular level. However, the biosphere level is not shown because it is above the organism level. Similarly, the atomic level is not shown as it is below the molecular level. This does not mean they do not exist; we simply did not indicate them in this scheme.

System levels in your activities are also determined as needed. Generally, in project activities, a limited number of system levels are used, and it's unlikely you will consider more than 3–5 levels in your work. However, completely disregarding them is impossible since there is always an interaction between levels (misalignments).

It is equally important to pay attention to other systems located at the same system level. You must be attentive to monitor surrounding systems and the physicality of part-whole relationships several system levels up and down. It's risky for a project to work without focused attention, to inadvertently drift into mental space, or to confuse what constitutes a part and what a whole.

Once we have established the system level, we can further discuss areas of interest. For example, in section 4, we identified areas of interest for the system level "automobile," and then we can discuss the areas of interest for the supersystem (automobile + driver) and the creator. Similarly, we can identify areas of interest for the system level "engine" or "piston." Different teams work on different system levels and with different areas of interest. When we need to create a 3x3 Table for a specific system, such as an automobile, it's crucial to understand that the table for an automobile differs from those for an engine or a piston, requiring three separate tables.

Note that system levels and areas of interest do not entirely overlap[^2]. These are different concepts applied to a selected system. In relation to this system of interest, areas of interest and system levels are identified. For example, if we take the system "automobile," the area of interest for the supersystem will be related to "automobile + driver"[^3]. The area of interest for the system of interest will be linked to "automobile"[^4]. However, the creator’s area of interest will not fall under the system levels "supersystem – system of interest – subsystem."

[^1]: Similarly, you will have to find names for parts and system levels in your work projects.

[^3]: Or "automobile" if creating a 3x3 Table for the "engine" system, or "engine" if creating a 3x3 Table for the piston.
[^4]: Or accordingly with the "engine," or with the "piston."
