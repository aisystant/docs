# Areas of Concern

In Section 3, we already introduced the concept of the subject of interest. Several related characteristics or subjects of interest can be grouped into an area of concern. These various areas of concern are the focus of specific roles in a project. Given the abundance of subjects of interest, it is convenient to organize them into specific areas.

A systems thinker assumes that each role wants to know (anticipates) how its preference will be considered. Therefore, roles whose subjects of interest it has been decided to satisfy need answers regarding this concern to assess the feasibility of their preferences.

Answers to each role's concern are provided in the form of descriptions as system documentation (models). Models are created only for subjects of interest and preferences that are chosen to be satisfied. However, it's not necessary for each preference to correspond to one model. Typically, models are compiled based on subjects or even areas of concern that the team has decided to address. For example, to address the concerns of the seller and buyer roles, a "cost estimate" model is created.

Since multiple systems are considered simultaneously in a project, and not just the system of interest, there will be many models in the project. All these models must be interconnected. Before their creation, it's also necessary to decide which specific models to create. For instance, besides the estimate for the system of interest, an expert evaluation or another description can be made, and the project will also require a budget for team maintenance (salary fund) as the description of the system-creator.

Thus, for the convenience of planning, creating, coordinating, and changing models in a project, areas of concern related to the following are introduced:

* The three main roles: areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the columns of Table 3x3;
* The three main systems: areas of concern for the supersystem, system of interest, and creator. These are the rows of Table 3x3.

Each area of concern will have its models, subjects of interest for roles, and their preferences, as well as work artifacts. It's fair to say that Table 3x3 highlights specific subjects of interest for the main roles at the level of particular subsystems. It acts as a sort of checklist. Consequently, when implementing any project, you can compile a list of documents (descriptions, models) that fulfill specific cells of the table.

The three areas of concern for the main roles draw attention to the necessity of having executors for all the roles listed in Table 3x3, who possess the relevant methods (practices) and create the necessary work artifacts.

The three areas of concern for the supersystem address the corresponding questions [ ^1 ] when applying a systems approach:

1. Supersystem area of concern: Why, for whom, and how should something be done, and how will they change their behavior if something new is offered to them? Here, it is crucial to hypothesize about which communities of people can improve their lives by being offered a system that allows them to play new roles and/or apply new methods (including technologies). For instance, Henry Ford offered adults a car, and people became drivers to address their spatial movement problems. Importantly, not everything needs to be new; roles and discipline may remain unchanged while you offer only new technology. For example, "SAP" for accountants who previously used Excel. The main objects of focus in this area of concern are the group or community of people with their dissatisfactions, their roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed system of interest.
2. System of interest area of concern: What is the new thing in terms of product (system), what are its characteristics, and how is it designed, and from what should it be created? Once hypotheses are set for the supersystem area of concern and the role of the system of interest is defined, we can move on to determining the system's design, including making architectural decisions. For example, watches for a space station, a person, and a tower will differ radically not only in materials but also in their fundamental operating principles. Here, it will be necessary to calculate the total cost of ownership of the system and estimate its price for the buyer.
3. Creation system area of concern: Who and how will create the system, including which methods, and with what resources? After hypotheses on the system's design are accepted, we proceed to its actual creation. It is essential to define the methods (practices) for its creation. Additionally, delineate all creator roles, select executor agents (people, contractor organizations, tools, and AI), and acquire other resources. Also, calculations regarding the profitability of the entire enterprise need to be conducted.
