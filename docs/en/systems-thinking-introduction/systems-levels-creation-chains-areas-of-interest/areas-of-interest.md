# Areas of Concern

In Section 3, we already became familiar with the concept of a subject of interest. Several related characteristics or subjects of interest can be grouped into an area of concern. These different areas of concern become focal points for specific roles within a project. Since there are quite a few subjects of interest, it is convenient to assemble them into defined areas.

A systems thinker operates under the assumption that every role wants to know (or predict) how its preferences will be considered. Therefore, for the roles whose subjects of interest are chosen to be accommodated, it is necessary to provide answers regarding these concerns to assess the feasibility of those preferences.

The responses to each role's concerns are found in descriptions, which take the form of system documentation (models). However, models are created only for the subjects of interest and preferences that are planned to be satisfied. Not every preference will necessarily correspond to a single model. Typically, models are not built around preferences but rather around subjects or even areas of concern that the team has decided to address. For instance, to address the concerns of both a seller and a buyer, a "budget" model might be created.

Since multiple systems are considered simultaneously in a project—not just the system of interest—there will be numerous models in the project. All these models must be interconnected. Before creating these models, decisions must be made about which models to create. For example, in addition to an estimate for the system of interest, an expert evaluation or another description might be made, and a project budget for the team (payroll) will be needed as a description of the creation system.

For convenience in planning, creating, coordinating, and modifying models, areas of concern are introduced into the project, relating to:

* the three primary roles—entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the columns of Table 3x3;
* the three key systems—supersystem, system of interest, and creation system. These are the rows of Table 3x3.

Each area of concern will have its own models, its own subjects of interest for roles and their preferences, as well as work artifacts. The 3x3 Table thus highlights specific subjects of interest for the main roles at the level of specific subsystems. It's a kind of checklist. Accordingly, in any project implementation, you can make a list of documents (descriptions, models) that cover specific cells of the table.

The three areas of concern for the main roles emphasize the need for performers for all the roles indicated in Table 3x3, who possess the corresponding methods (practices) and create the necessary work artifacts.

The three areas of concern for the supersystem address the corresponding questions [ ^1 ] when using a systems approach:

1. The area of concern for the supersystem: Why, for whom, and how should something be done, and how will their behavior change if something new is offered to them? Here, it's necessary to hypothesize which communities might improve their lives through the system you offer, enabling them to play new roles and/or use new methods (including technologies). For example, Henry Ford offered a passenger vehicle to all adults, turning people into drivers to solve their transportation problems. Note that not everything has to be new—the roles and discipline may remain unchanged while you offer just a new technology, such as "SAP" for accountants who previously used Excel. In this area of concern, the main focal points are groups or communities of people with their dissatisfactions, their roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed system of interest.
2. The area of concern for the system of interest: What is this new thing in terms of the product (system), what are its characteristics, and how is it structured? Once hypotheses are set regarding the supersystem's area of concern and the role of the system of interest is defined, you can proceed to define the system’s structure, including making architectural decisions. For example, watches for a space station, a person, and a tower will differ not only in materials but also in their fundamental operating principles. Here, it will be necessary to calculate the total cost of ownership of the system and estimate its price for the buyer.
3. The area of concern for creation systems: Who and how will create the system, using what methods, and with what resources? Once the assumptions regarding the system's structure have been made, we proceed to its creation. This requires defining methods (practices) for its creation, identifying all creator roles, selecting executors (people, contracting organizations, tools, and AI), and acquiring other resources. Additionally, calculations regarding the profitability of the entire enterprise must be made.
