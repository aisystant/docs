### Understanding Areas of Interest

In Section 3, we were introduced to the concept of a **subject of interest**. Multiple related characteristics or subjects of interest can be grouped into an **area of concern**. These different areas of concern are focal points for specific roles within a project. Given the multitude of subjects of interest, organizing them into particular areas can be quite advantageous.

A systems-oriented thinker assumes that each role desires to know (or predict) how its preference will be accommodated. Therefore, roles with subjects of interest that have been decided to fulfill must receive responses about their concerns, which allows them to evaluate the feasibility of their preferences.

### Documentation as Responses

Responses to each role's concerns are provided as documentation (models). These models are developed solely for subjects of interest and preferences deemed worthy of satisfaction. Not every preference demands a separate model; usually, they are crafted based on subjects or even areas of interest that the team chooses to fulfill. For instance, to address the concerns of both a seller and a buyer, a "budget estimate" model might be developed.

### Multiple Systems and Interconnected Models

As multiple systems—not just the system of interest—are examined in a project, there will be many models. All these models need to be interconnected. Before creation, it's crucial to determine which specific models are necessary. For instance, besides a budget estimate for the system of interest, an expert evaluation or other descriptions might be created. Additionally, a budget outline for the team (salary fund) is needed as a part of the system-creator description.

### Introducing Areas of Interest for Planning

For planning, creating, agreeing upon, and modifying models in the project, areas of interest are established:

- **Three Main Roles**: Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Manager, represented by the columns in the 3x3 Table.
- **Three Main Systems**: Supersystem, the System of Interest, and the Creator, depicted by the rows in the 3x3 Table.

Each area of concern will have its models, role-specific subjects of interest, preferences, and work artifacts. The 3x3 Table highlights certain subjects of interest for key roles at the level of specific subsystems, acting as a checklist. During any project implementation, you can create a list of documents (descriptions, models) that address specific cells of the table.

### Roles and Methods in the 3x3 Table

The three areas of interest for key roles emphasize the need for executors of all roles designated in the 3x3 Table. These executors should possess the relevant methods (practices) and create the necessary work artifacts.

### Addressing Supersystem Questions

The three areas of interest concerning the supersystem respond to relevant questions during the application of a systems approach:

1. **Supersystem's Area of Interest**: Why and for whom should something be done, and how will they change their behavior if offered something new? Hypothesize which segments of society could enhance their lives through the offered system allowing them to assume new roles and/or employ new methods (including technologies). For example, Henry Ford introduced the automobile to all adults, allowing them to become drivers to solve spatial movement issues. Not everything has to be new; roles and disciplines might remain unchanged, while only new technology is offered, like "SAP" for accountants previously using Excel. Key focuses in this area include groups or communities with their dissatisfactions, roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed system of interest.

2. **System of Interest's Area**: What is this new thing product-wise (system), its characteristics, and its construction method? Once hypotheses concerning the supersystem's area are established and the system of interest's role is defined, defining the system's structure and making architectural decisions can commence. Clocks for a space station, an individual, and a tower will differ not only in materials but in principal operation schemes. Comprehensive ownership cost and buyer price estimates will also be necessary here.

3. **Creation Systems' Area of Interest**: Who and how will the system be developed, with which methods and resources? Following the acceptance of system design hypotheses, proceeding to direct system creation involves determining methods (practices) for its development. Identifying all creation roles, selecting executor-agents (people, contractor organizations, tools, and AI), and acquiring other resources will be crucial. Additionally, profitability calculations for the entire venture should be made.
