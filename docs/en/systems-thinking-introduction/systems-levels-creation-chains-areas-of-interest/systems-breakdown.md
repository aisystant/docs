# System Breakdown

We have figured out areas of interest, and now we'll talk about system breakdown and system levels. It is important not to confuse the concepts of "areas of interest" (of systems and roles) with "system levels."

As you already know, systems can be viewed from different perspectives:

* when a system acts as a whole for certain parts within it, meaning the entire system consists of subsystems;
* when a system is a part of some supersystem, meaning the system itself is a subsystem.

Every subsystem is also a whole for its sub-subsystems, and each supersystem is part of a higher supersystem. This allows for discussing system breakdown from top to bottom or bottom to top. If we do not plan to further divide a system into parts, it is called an "element of the system," emphasizing that there is a whole system somewhere for which this subsystem is an element.

Levels in system breakdown are known as system levels. They are identified by focusing attention using the part-whole relationship. Through this, we logically delineate these levels in the physical world. Of course, there are no special level boundaries in the physical worldâ€”it's the systems thinker who identifies them by focusing attention.

The classic system breakdown into levels comes from biology. The illustration shows that cells consist of molecules, but cells themselves are parts of organs. Organs consist of cells, but organs are parts of organisms, and so forth. A person acting in the particular role of a biologist decided to divide the world into parts this way and found corresponding names for these parts and levels. [ ^1 ]

The illustration shows system levels: organisms, organs, cells, and the system level of molecules. However, it does not show the system level of the biosphere, as it is above the level of organisms. Nor does it show the system level of atoms, as it is below the level of molecules. This doesn't mean they don't exist; they are simply not included in this diagram.

System levels in your activities are also determined as necessary. Generally, in project activities, a limited number of system levels are used, and you are unlikely to consider more than 3-5 levels in your work. However, you should not disregard them entirely, as interactions always occur between levels (misalignments).

It is important to pay attention to other systems at the same system level. Your attention must be sufficient to track surrounding systems and the physicality of part-whole relationships across several system levels, both up and down. Working without focused attention, unconsciously straying into mental space or confusing what is part and what is whole can be dangerous for the project.

Once a system level is established, we can then discuss areas of interest. For example, in Section 4, we identified areas of interest for the system level "car," and then we can discuss areas of interest for the supersystem (car+driver) and the creator. Similarly, areas of interest can be identified for the system level "engine" or "piston." Different teams work at different system levels and with different areas of interest. When we need to construct a 3x3 Table for a specific system, like a car, we need to understand that the table for the car differs from the table for the engine and piston, requiring three different tables.

Pay attention that system levels and areas of interest do not completely overlap. [ ^2 ] They are different concepts applied to the chosen system. For the system of interest, areas of interest and system levels are identified. For example, if we consider the system "car," the area of interest for the supersystem will be associated with "car+driver," [ ^3 ] while the area of interest for the system of interest will be associated with the "car." [ ^4 ] However, the area of interest for the creator will not fall within the system levels of "supersystem - system of interest - subsystem."

[ ^1 ]: Just as you will need to find names for parts and system levels in your work projects.

[ ^2 ]: If you are experiencing misunderstandings here, consult your instructor. Without understanding this distinction, further study of the textbook will be impossible.

[ ^3 ]: Or "car" if creating a 3x3 Table for the "engine" system or "engine" if creating a 3x3 Table for the piston.

[ ^4 ]: Or accordingly with the "engine" or "piston."
