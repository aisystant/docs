# Areas of Interests for Entrepreneurs, Engineers, and Managers

Let's examine more closely the three areas of interest and discuss the interests of the three primary roles—entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are known as activity roles, widely recognized in culture (with textbooks written about them, and they are relatively easy to identify) and can be used to explain other roles (serving as a meta-model for other roles).

For instance, if you are well-versed in medicine, you are familiar with many roles within the "doctors" category. An adult typically has a fairly good grasp of medical activities. However, if you wish to create successful systems and/or aim for career advancement, you also need to understand the roles and work artifacts of entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers. The activity role of a doctor can also be explained through these three primary roles. For example, the role of a dentist is an engineering role in the project of dental treatment, and a chief physician is a position where a person is likely to also perform the role of a manager among others.

The three areas of interest for these roles represent the minimal professional (activity) insight required in today's world. Regardless of your position or the roles you play, you need to understand, at a basic level, the subjects of interest to entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers in a specific project or enterprise.

This insight is crucial for everyone, as we all, in one way or another, perform the roles of an entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, even in personal projects. Questions such as where to study or invest time, how to shape oneself or a child into a constructor, and how to manage resources are ones that everyone regularly answers.

Let's turn our attention to the 3x3 Table and review it through the lens of these three primary roles. Notice that, for example, a cook in the project of cooking soup acts in an activity role—as an engineer—but their area is not confined to the soup system since they may be interested in presenting the dish to the eater, managing the kitchen space, ingredients, utensils, etc. Thus, the engineer is interested not only in the system of interest but also in others. From this perspective, we can outline the general descriptions of the subjects of interest, roles, and work artifacts for each cell in the table.

An entrepreneur is interested in how to earn consistently (now and in the future) by addressing someone's dissatisfaction. The class of "entrepreneurs" has interests and corresponding roles:

* Promoter (including educator, marketer, seller) — an entrepreneur focusing on the external environment (market, opportunities) or the supersystem, including the client base and its dissatisfaction;
* Visionary (strategist) — an entrepreneur interested in the demand (profitability of sales) of a specific system of interest now and in the future;
* Businessperson (founder) — an entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the system of interest.

An engineer is focused on the system of interest, which should improve the world. The class of "engineers" has interests and corresponding roles:

* Product Owner — an engineer interested in modeling and documenting use cases of the system of interest within the supersystem;
* Engineer of the system of interest — an engineer interested in creating a successful system of interest (one instance), addressing all stakeholders. Roles in the class "engineers" can include architects and developers;
* Development Organizer (DevOps, platform technology architect, methods manager) — an engineer focused on the enterprise's functional ability (creation systems) to produce the system of interest, including in the required quantity.

A manager is interested in the creation systems that must produce the systems of interest, and in the necessary quantity (not just one):

* Relationship Manager (PR, GR, etc.) — a manager focused on accounting for external stakeholders concerning the enterprise, including its image and managing communications with various interested parties, such as investors and the public;
* Operations Manager — a manager or work supervisor interested in creating and delivering the system of interest on time and within budget, organizing existing personnel to fulfill corresponding roles in the pre-planned enterprise;
* Administrator — a manager concerned with the operability and readiness to operate all enterprise systems, including qualified personnel, necessary resources (turnover), and functioning tools (technologies).

The team’s workflow can be explained as follows:

1. Initially, the entrepreneur identifies a potential client group and their problems (target group). Then, they discern how these problems can be solved and determine the potential system of interest. They also find resources to organize business activities;
2. Next, a systems engineer^[In roles such as developer, architect, etc.] connects, identifying the needs of the project roles and devising the structure for the system of interest that should address the problems identified by the entrepreneur's client group;
3. Following this, the manager establishes and administers the enterprise, which must produce the necessary number of systems of interest to resolve the target client group's problems, and informs all external project roles on how their interests are being considered.

No matter what role you have or position you hold, it's advisable to understand the areas of interest of systems and the subjects pertinent to the three main roles. You must be able to think about all of this together and, when necessary, separately, managing your focus.
