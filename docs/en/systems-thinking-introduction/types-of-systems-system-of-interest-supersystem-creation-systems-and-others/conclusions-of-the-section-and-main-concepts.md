# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

First, we have become familiar with the following types of systems: the system of interest, the supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, surrounding systems, and "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects, so that you develop fluency in breaking down the world into different systems.

Second, we discussed the difference between activities and systems, products and services, and services and functions. You might feel that many of these concepts are unnecessary, but trust usâ€”they were created to more accurately describe the various interests that are discussed when building a successful system.

One of the main systems techniques is the ability to distinguish and see the connections between the main types of systems.

Key concepts: system of interest, supersystem, systems environment, system-creator, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
