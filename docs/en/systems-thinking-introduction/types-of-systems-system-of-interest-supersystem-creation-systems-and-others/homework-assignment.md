# Homework Assignment

**Q1.** Describe what your enterprise does: does it sell a product or provide a service? To whom?

**Q2.** Write and publish a draft in the AISYSTANT blog on one of the topics (concepts) from the recent discussion. For example, about the difference between the system of interest and our system in your project, or about the difference between the concepts of "function" and "service." Alternatively, you can publish your answers to the "Questions for review, discussion, and thinking through writing" as a draft in the AISYSTANT club.

**Q3.** Comment on 2 drafts from your fellow students, paying attention to how they model the world and which main concepts they use for this.

**Q4.** Record the amount of time you invested in studying this section. Analyze how well you followed your time investment plan, including paying attention to the regularity of your studies, any problems encountered, and your successes.
