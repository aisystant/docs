# Description Method

You already know that a system description consists of role-based descriptions, which in turn consist of models. To create a role-based description, a description method (practice) is needed. The description method is presented as a theory that explains how to create system descriptions and provides the necessary tools to produce a work artifact (documentation). In the theory, metamodels are defined, which are filled with data and correspondingly become models. Models can exist on different media, such as paper or in a computer, and then we refer to them as documentation.

It is simplest to consider the description method, from a substantive point of view, as a set of notations for multi-layered map models that describe a territory. The territory is the system; the map is the documentation describing the system. However, there is a method for creating the map^[For example, the photogrammetric method for creating topographic maps.], which includes metamodels, concepts, principles, and so on. The theory of creating this description, along with the technology for making the map, constitutes the description method.

The universality of the high-level modeling approach means that the description is made in response to a specific subject of interest (or preference) to the particular system, and for this, the role(s) utilize a specific description method, with which the documentation is generated and addressed to another role. For example, a topological map is created in response to the interest "relief" of the system "territory" (some locality). The map is created by topographers and used by surveyors, geologists, geographers, or even designers who are creating a house project.

The description method allows for the creation of descriptions of any systems. Of course, it is necessary to first pay attention to the system of interest, but in project activities or within an enterprise, you will encounter numerous documents that describe a wide variety of systems (supersystems, subsystems, creation systems, etc.).

In the table above, you see the connection between the concepts of role, interest, role-based description, and description method. Note that you have often seen similar role-based descriptions in the form of documents. Many of you possess various description methods, through which you create specific documents. Be sure to describe your roles, description methods, and work artifacts in the corresponding modeling exercise from the course.

Different roles may share the same interest, but their role-based descriptions might vary. One role may have multiple interests. In this case, a single description can be created that addresses several subjects of interest.

It is important to choose the right description methods. For example, different methods are needed for tax, financial, and management descriptions. For tax, tax and accounting methods are used; for financial description, IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP; and for financial management descriptions, there are managerial accounting methods. Note that all three descriptions (methods and work artifacts) are created for three different rolesâ€”tax accountant, shareholder, and manager.

You already understand well that it is not possible to create quality role-based descriptions if the role-based description method and the corresponding documentation are not explicitly considered. In other words, they cannot be created unconsciously. Conscious application of the description method increases the likelihood that you will promptly notice the necessity to master a new method.
