# System Documentation

Descriptions reflect everything essential about a system, answering the subjects of interest for project roles decided to be satisfied during system creation. Creating a consistent description increases the likelihood of successfully implementing the system of interest in the physical world.

Systems modeling is undertaken through thinking through writing, employing specialized tools known as modelers. Examples of such modelers include pen and paper, Word, a wall with sticky notes and a marker, and more advanced modelers like Coda [ ^1 ], CAD (computer-aided design) [ ^2 ], etc.

The work artifact of systems modeling using modelers is documentation. Ultimately, this documentation becomes external memory for the team (an exocortex) [ ^3 ]. The documentation format [ ^4 ] can be text, outlines, tables, computer models, and so on.

Our course is also a modeler, appearing as tables or high-level models in which important systems thinking concepts are linked together. Using the course as a simulator, you can practice mastering the necessary concepts for such high-level modeling (not fully related to a specific subject area). High-level modeling involves designating [ ^5 ] all important systems and subsystems, as well as their interrelationships. Moreover, understanding high-level models requires at least comprehending the connection between method description and subjects of interest, distinguishing between “black” and “transparent” boxes, and expanding your horizon regarding the names and contents of key documents in major areas of interest [ ^6 ].

In the future, you may use any spreadsheet editor (such as Coda) to describe your project and the systems involved at a high level. However, for detailed modeling and creating corresponding documents for role interests, you need to use applied theories and tools [ ^7 ]. For example, CAD, 1C, PDM (Product Data Management) [ ^8 ], CRM (customer relationship management) [ ^9 ], and many others.

Within our course, you will learn what types of documents exist, which subjects of interest they address, how they are interconnected, and by what methods of description they are created. However, within the course [ ^10 ], you will not study or create specific documents with models and descriptions. For instance, we will discuss documents that describe a target audience or project roles, and also about usage concepts and architecture, but to develop specific instances of these documents, you will need to study the relevant applied practices (description methods).

Usually, a project or enterprise team includes specialists in applied methods (marketers, architects, product owners, etc.) who specialize in developing certain documents describing various subjects of interest. The objective of our course is to understand that all these documents can be viewed similarly [ ^11 ] and to see their interconnections, which requires first mastering the systems language. This involves knowing the corresponding concepts of systems modeling.

[ ^1 ]: For high-level modeling, which describes all important systems and subsystems, as well as their interconnections.

[ ^2 ]: For more detailed (subject-specific, applied) design, including the creation of engineering and technological documentation.

[ ^3 ]: In one sense, a modeler is also an exocortex, but the result of modeling is also considered an exocortex. This is an analogy to the brain, which conducts thinking, and then the result appears, which is also contained within the brain. However, we consider documentation to be neither a biological brain nor merely paper or computer models accessible not only to their developer.

[ ^4 ]: The content of documentation consists of descriptions defined by the subjects of interest for the project roles regarding the system.

[ ^5 ]: Title and brief description (for example, function, structure, etc.).

[ ^6 ]: For example, it is essential to know what the documents “Usage Concept” and “System Concept” are, as well as how they differ from a “Balance Sheet” or a “Target Audience Description.”

[ ^7 ]: These need to be studied separately. For example, composing a balance sheet (as an answer to the subject of interest—taxes) requires studying accounting theory and mastering the tool (for example, 1C).

[ ^8 ]: Product Data Management system or product versioning system.

[ ^9 ]: CRM contains databases that describe the client base as a whole system in the physical world, with parts of the client base being individual clients.

[ ^10 ]: And even within the context of systems thinking.

[ ^11 ]: For example, seeing the roles that create them and understanding through what methods. Or paying attention to the project roles the created documentation will address.
