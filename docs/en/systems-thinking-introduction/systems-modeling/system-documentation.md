# System Documentation

Descriptions capture everything crucial about a system, addressing the subjects of interest for project roles that are decided to be satisfied during the system's creation. Crafting a consistent description increases the likelihood of realizing a successful system of interest in the physical world.

Systems modeling is carried out through thinking through writing, employing special tools known as modelers. Examples of such modelers include a pen and paper, Word, a wall with sticky notes and markers, with more advanced modelers being tools like Coda [ ^1 ], CAD (computer-aided design) [ ^2 ], and so on.

The work artifact of systems modeling using modelers is documentation. Ultimately, documentation becomes an external memory for the team (exocortex) [ ^3 ]. The format of documentation [ ^4 ] can be text, outlines, tables, computer models, etc.

Our course itself acts as a modeler in the form of tables or high-level models that interlink important systems thinking concepts. With the course serving as a simulator, you can practice thinking mastery required for such high-level modeling (not fully related to the subject area). High-level modeling includes designating [ ^5 ] all significant systems and subsystems and their interconnections. Additionally, understanding high-level models requires, at a minimum, recognizing the connection between description methods and subjects of interest, distinguishing between "black" and "transparent" boxes, and expanding your understanding of the titles and content of main documents across primary areas of interest [ ^6 ].

In the future, you can utilize any spreadsheet editor (e.g., Coda) to describe your project and the systems involved at a high level. However, for subject-specific modeling and creating relevant documents for role interests, applied theories and instruments are necessary [ ^7 ]. Examples include CAD, 1C, PDM (Product Data Management) [ ^8 ], CRM (customer relationship management) [ ^9 ], and many others.

Within our course, you will learn about the types of documents that exist, the subjects of interest they address, how they are interrelated, and the description methods used to create them. However, within the course [ ^10 ], you will not be studying or creating specific documents with models and descriptions. For instance, while we will discuss documents that describe the target audience or project roles, the concept of usage, and architecture, developing concrete instances of these documents requires studying the corresponding applied practices (description methods).

Typically, a project or enterprise team includes specialists in applied methods (marketers, architects, product owners, etc.) who are proficient in developing specific documents with descriptions of various subjects of interest. The goal of our course is to understand that all these documents can be viewed in a uniform manner [ ^11 ], identifying their interconnections, which requires mastering the systems language as a starting point. This means understanding the relevant concepts of systems modeling.

[ ^1 ]: For high-level modeling where all critical systems and subsystems, as well as their interconnections, are described.

[ ^2 ]: For more detailed (subject-specific, applied) design, including the creation of design and technological documentation.

[ ^3 ]: On one hand, the modeler is also considered an exocortex, but the result of modeling is also seen as an exocortex. It's an analogy to the brain, which performs the thinking, and the result is also contained in the brain. However, we consider documentation as non-biological brain, meaning paper or computer models accessible to more than just their developer.

[ ^4 ]: The content of documentation consists of descriptions defined by the subjects of interest of project roles in the system.

[ ^5 ]: Name and brief description (for example, function, structure, etc.).

[ ^6 ]: For example, itâ€™s necessary to know what distinguishes "Usage Concept" and "System Concept" documents from a "Balance Sheet" or "Target Audience Description."

[ ^7 ]: These need to be studied separately. For instance, creating a balance sheet document (as a response to subjects of interest like taxes) requires studying accounting theory and mastering a tool (e.g., 1C).

[ ^8 ]: Product Data Management or product versioning system.

[ ^9 ]: CRM contains databases that describe the client base as a comprehensive system in the physical world, where the parts of the client base are individual clients.

[ ^10 ]: And even within the systems thinking course.

[ ^11 ]: For example, identifying the roles that create them and understanding the methods they use. Or focusing on the project roles that the created documentation will address.
