# Description of a System as a "Black Box"

When we consider a system as a black box, we focus on its interaction with the external world—what functions it performs, what interfaces it uses, the possible states it can be in, and what characteristics affect its operation. The internal workings of the system remain outside the scope of this analysis (that would be the consideration of the system as a transparent box).

We can identify the following descriptions for viewing a system as a black box:

1. Function of the system—what the system does and its purpose.
2. Interfaces of the system—how it interacts with the external world.
3. States of the system—the various conditions it may occupy.
4. Characteristics of the system—the properties that influence its operation.

These descriptions help us understand how a system works without examining its internal mechanisms, which is useful when designing, analyzing, or integrating the system into more complex structures. Describing a system as a black box provides a universal representation of it, and the usage concept specifies its operation within specific scenarios.

Let's discuss each description using a few examples.

**System Function** answers the question of what the system does and what task it addresses. The function describes the primary purpose of the system.

Examples:

* A vehicle performs the function of transporting people and goods.
* A person in the role of a thinker performs the function of processing information and executing physical or intellectual tasks.
* A phone performs the function of transmitting and processing voice, text, and digital data.

The function of a system directly determines what interfaces it requires. For example, if a phone's function is data transmission, it must have the appropriate communication interfaces (screen, speaker, microphone, touch input). If a system acquires additional functions, it may need new interfaces or modifications to existing ones.

**Interfaces** describe how the system interacts with the external world. An interface is a description of interaction rules, and interface modules are the physical objects that implement these rules.

Examples:

* A vehicle has a driving interface that describes how the driver gives commands to the vehicle. Interface modules: steering wheel, accelerator pedal, brake, gear shift lever.
* A person has a visual interface that describes the rules of perceiving visual information. Interface module: eyes.
* A phone has a tactile management interface that describes how a user interacts with the device through touch. Interface module: touchscreen.

Interfaces are closely linked to system states. For instance, if a vehicle is in the "moving" state, the driving interface allows for changing speed and direction. However, if the vehicle is in the "faulty" state, some interfaces may become unavailable.

**System States** answer the question of the modes in which it can operate at various times.

Examples:

* Vehicle: moving, stationary, faulty.
* Person: awake, asleep, sick, tired.
* Phone: on, off, in power-saving mode.

States determine which functions the system can currently perform and which interfaces are active. For example, if a phone is off, its management interface is unavailable, and it cannot perform its data transmission function. In some systems, states may change automatically depending on characteristics (for example, a phone may enter power-saving mode when its battery is low).

Characteristics (or subjects of interest) answer the question of what properties of the system influence its operation. They define its capabilities and limitations.

Examples:

* Vehicle: speed, fuel consumption, load capacity.
* Person: strength, intelligence, endurance, reaction speed.
* Phone: weight, performance, screen resolution.

The system's characteristics directly affect interfaces and states. For example, if a vehicle has a low maximum speed, it influences the behavior of the driving interface. If a phone has a weak processor, it might more frequently switch to a "response delay" state, reducing the quality of user interaction with the interface.

Therefore, descriptions of a system as a black box—function, interfaces, states, and characteristics—provide us with a comprehensive understanding of how the system works and interacts with the external world. However, to understand why and in which conditions this system is applied, we need to develop a concept of system usage. It helps connect the technical and functional characteristics of the system with its real-world application scenarios, specifying which of its properties and capabilities are most important in a given context.

**System Usage Concept** describes the conditions, by whom and how the system is used. This is not part of the description of the system as a black box but helps select important characteristics, interfaces, and functions for a specific usage scenario.

Examples:

* A vehicle can be used as a personal means of transportation, a taxi, or a truck.
* A person performs roles such as worker, student, athlete in different contexts.
* A phone can be a personal device, a corporate tool, or a gaming platform.

The main purpose of the usage concept is to understand what changes the system causes in the surroundings, and how it performs its primary function. This helps determine what exactly the system must do to bring "irreparable benefit" to the supersystem. Such an approach allows focusing on the results and effect the system should achieve, without being distracted by the details of its internal organization. In the usage concept, functions, interfaces, states, and characteristics of the system that are important in specific conditions are defined. For instance, a taxi requires an interface for communication with a dispatcher, while a truck requires interfaces for handling load capacity. It is crucial to understand that the same system can be employed in different concepts, and its parameters should align with the chosen scenario.

When analyzing a system as a black box, it is important to consider several key aspects:

* The function of the system answers the question of what it does.
* The interfaces of the system describe how it interacts with the world and through which interface modules this is implemented.
* The states of the system define the modes in which it operates.
* The characteristics of the system set the parameters that define its capabilities.
* The usage concept explains where, by whom, and how the system is applied, determining which system description parameters are most important in the specific context.

This approach allows for analyzing the system without delving into its internal mechanics, which is necessary when designing, researching, and integrating systems into more complex supersystems.
