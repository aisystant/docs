# Description of the System as a "Black Box"

When we view a system as a black box, we focus on its interaction with the external world—what functions it performs, what interfaces it uses, what states it can exist in, and what characteristics affect its operation. The internal structure of the system remains outside the scope of analysis (which is considered when viewing the system as a transparent box).

We can highlight the following descriptions of a system as a black box:

1. **Function of the System** – What does the system do, and what is its goal?
2. **Interfaces of the System** – How does it interact with the external world?
3. **States of the System** – What states can the system be in?
4. **Characteristics of the System** – What properties affect its operation?

These descriptions help understand how a system works without studying its internal mechanisms, which is useful for designing, analyzing, or integrating a system into more complex structures. Describing a system as a black box provides a universal representation, while the usage concept specifies its operation in specific scenarios.

Let's examine each description with several examples.

**Function of the System** answers what the system does and what task it solves. The function describes the primary purpose of the system.

Examples:

* A vehicle performs the function of transporting people and goods.
* A person in the role of a thinker performs the function of processing information and carrying out physical or intellectual tasks.
* A phone performs the function of transmitting and processing voice, text, and digital data.

The function of the system directly determines which interfaces are necessary. For instance, if the function of a phone is data transmission, it needs appropriate communication interfaces (screen, speaker, microphone, touch input). If a system gains additional functions, it may require new interfaces or modifications of existing ones.

**Interfaces** describe how the system interacts with the external world. An interface is the description of interaction rules, while interface modules are the physical objects that implement these rules.

Examples:

* A vehicle has a movement control interface that describes how the driver gives commands to the car. Interface modules: steering wheel, accelerator pedal, brake, gear shift lever.
* A person has a visual interface that describes rules for perceiving visual information. Interface module: eyes.
* A phone has a tactile control interface, describing how a user interacts with the phone through touch. Interface module: touch screen.

Interfaces are strongly connected with the system states. For example, if a car is in the "moving" state, the control interface allows for changing speed and direction. But if the car is in the "faulty" state, some interfaces may become unavailable.

**States of the System** answer what modes it can be in at different times.

Examples:

* A vehicle: moving, stationary, faulty.
* A person: awake, asleep, sick, tired.
* A phone: on, off, in power-saving mode.

States determine what functions the system can perform at any given moment and which interfaces are active. For instance, if a phone is off, its control interface is unavailable, and it cannot perform its data transmission function. In some systems, states can change automatically depending on characteristics (e.g., a phone entering power-saving mode when the battery is low).

Characteristics (or subjects of interest) answer what properties affect the system's operation. They define its capabilities and limitations.

Examples:

* A vehicle: speed, fuel consumption, cargo capacity.
* A person: strength, intelligence, endurance, reaction speed.
* A phone: weight, performance, screen resolution.

The characteristics of a system directly affect its interfaces and states. For example, if a vehicle has a low maximum speed, it influences the behavior of the movement control interface. If a phone has a weak processor, it may more frequently enter a "response delay" state, reducing the quality of user interaction with the interface.

Thus, descriptions of the system as a black box—the function, interfaces, states, and characteristics—provide us a comprehensive understanding of how the system operates and interacts with the external world. However, to understand why and under what conditions this system is used, we need to develop a usage concept. It helps tie the technical and functional characteristics of the system to real-world use cases, identifying which properties and capabilities are most important in a specific context.

**Usage Concept of the System** describes under what conditions, by whom, and how the system is used. Though not part of the black box description, it helps select important characteristics, interfaces, and functions for specific usage scenarios.

Examples:

* A vehicle can be used as a personal means of transport, a taxi, or a truck.
* A person, in various contexts, undertakes roles such as a worker, student, or athlete.
* A phone can be a personal device, a corporate tool, or a gaming platform.

The main goal of the usage concept is to understand what changes the system brings to its surroundings and how it performs its main function. This helps to determine what the system must do to provide "indispensable benefits" in the supersystem. This approach allows focusing on the outcomes and effects the system should achieve without getting sidetracked by the details of its internal mechanisms. In the usage concept, the functions, interfaces, states, and characteristics of the system, which are important in particular conditions, are identified. For example, a taxi requires a communication interface with a dispatcher, whereas a truck needs cargo capacity management interfaces. It is important to understand that the same system can be used in different concepts, and its parameters must align with the chosen scenario.

When analyzing a system as a black box, it's important to consider several key aspects:

* The system's function answers what it does.
* The system's interfaces describe how it interacts with the world and through which interface modules this is implemented.
* The system's states determine what modes it operates in.
* The system's characteristics set parameters that define its capabilities.
* The usage concept explains where, by whom, and how the system is applied, identifying which system description parameters are most important in a specific context.

Such an approach allows for system analysis without studying its internal structure, which is necessary for designing, researching, and integrating systems into more complex supersystems.
