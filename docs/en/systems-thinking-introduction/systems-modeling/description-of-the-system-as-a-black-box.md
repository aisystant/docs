# Describing a System as a "Black Box"

When we consider a system as a black box, we're interested in its interaction with the external world—what functions it performs, what interfaces it uses, what states it can be in, and what characteristics affect its operation. The internal workings of the system remain outside the scope of analysis (this is considered when viewing the system as a transparent box).

We can delineate the following descriptions of a system as a black box:

1. **System Function**: What the system does and what its purpose is.
2. **System Interfaces**: Through which it interacts with the external world.
3. **System States**: What states the system can be in.
4. **System Characteristics**: Which properties influence its operation.

These descriptions help us understand how the system functions without delving into its internal mechanisms, which is useful when designing, analyzing, or integrating the system into more complex structures. Describing a system as a black box provides a universal understanding, while the usage concept refines its operation in specific scenarios.

Let's examine each description through several examples.

**System Function** addresses the question of what the system does and what task it solves. The function describes the primary purpose of the system.

Examples:

* A car performs the function of transporting people and goods.
* A human in the role of a thinker performs the function of processing information and carrying out physical or intellectual tasks.
* A phone performs the function of transmitting and processing voice, text, and digital data.

The system's function directly determines what interfaces it needs. For example, if a phone's function is data transmission, it must have the necessary communication interfaces (screen, speaker, microphone, touch input). If a system gains additional functions, it may require new interfaces or modifications to existing ones.

**Interfaces** describe how the system interacts with the external world. An interface is a description of interaction rules, and interface modules are physical objects that implement these rules.

Examples:

* A car has a motion control interface, which describes how the driver commands the car. Interface modules: steering wheel, gas pedal, brake, gear lever.
* A human has a visual interface that describes the rules for perceiving visual information. Interface module: eyes.
* A phone has a tactile control interface describing how a user interacts with the phone through touch. Interface module: touch screen.

Interfaces are closely tied to system states. For example, if a car is in the "moving" state, the control interface allows changes in speed and direction. But if the car is in the "malfunction" state, some interfaces may become unavailable.

**System States** answer the question of what modes it can be in at various moments.

Examples:

* Car: moving, stationary, malfunctioning.
* Human: awake, asleep, sick, tired.
* Phone: on, off, in power-saving mode.

States determine what functions the system can perform at a given moment and which interfaces are active. For instance, if a phone is off, its control interface is unavailable, and it cannot perform its data transmission function. In some systems, states may change automatically based on characteristics (e.g., a phone enters power-saving mode when the battery is low).

**Characteristics** (or subjects of interest) answer which properties of the system affect its operation. They define its capabilities and limitations.

Examples:

* Car: speed, fuel consumption, load capacity.
* Human: strength, intelligence, endurance, reaction speed.
* Phone: weight, performance, screen resolution.

The system's characteristics directly influence the interfaces and states. For example, if a car has a low maximum speed, it affects the behavior of the motion control interface. If a phone has a weak processor, it may more often enter a "response delay" state, reducing the quality of user interaction with the interface.

Thus, the descriptions of a system as a black box—function, interfaces, states, and characteristics—offer us a comprehensive view of how the system works and interacts with the external world. However, to understand why and under what conditions this system is applied, we need to develop a usage concept. This helps connect the system's technical and functional features with its actual application scenarios, determining which of its properties and capabilities are most important in a specific context.

**Usage Concept** describes in what conditions, by whom, and how the system is used. It is not part of the black box description but helps select important characteristics, interfaces, and functions for a specific use scenario.

Examples:

* A car can be used as a personal means of transport, a taxi, a truck.
* A person, in different contexts, assumes roles of worker, student, athlete.
* A phone can be a personal device, a corporate tool, or a gaming platform.

The main goal of the usage concept is to understand what changes the system causes in the surroundings, and how it performs its main function. This helps determine what exactly the system should do to provide "irrefutable benefits" in the supersystem. Such an approach focuses on the outcomes and effects the system should achieve, without being distracted by the details of its internal workings. In the usage concept, the functions, interfaces, states, and characteristics of the system that are important in specific conditions are defined. For instance, a taxi requires a communication interface with a dispatcher, while a truck demands cargo management interfaces. It's important to understand that the same system can be used in different concepts, and its parameters should align with the chosen scenario.

When analyzing a system as a black box, it is crucial to consider several key aspects:

* The function of the system answers the question of what it does.
* The interfaces of the system describe how it interacts with the world and through which interface modules this is realized.
* The states of the system determine in which modes it operates.
* The system characteristics set the parameters that define its capabilities.
* The usage concept explains where, by whom, and how the system is applied, determining which system description parameters are most important in a specific context.

This approach allows analyzing the system without studying its internal structure, which is necessary when designing, researching, and integrating systems into more complex supersystems.
