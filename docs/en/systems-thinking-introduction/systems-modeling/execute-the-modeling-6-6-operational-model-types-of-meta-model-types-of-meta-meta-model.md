# Perform Modeling: 6.6. Operational Model, Types of Meta-Model, Types of Meta-Meta-Model

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Note that the data presented may apply to a wide range of situations; it is sufficient to describe any variant. The main thing is not to make methodological errors.

Provide examples of chains in relation to meta-modeling for objects from your project, based on the example in the first row. Do not worry too much about distinguishing between functional and structural objects and their types. It is important for you to differentiate a real object from the physical world of the project, its type from a discipline within the project's subject area, and the type of discipline from the intellect stack (from our textbook)â€”and in addition to differentiation, also understand their correspondence.

Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
