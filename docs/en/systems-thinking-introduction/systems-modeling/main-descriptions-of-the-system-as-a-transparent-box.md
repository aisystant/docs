# Main Descriptions of the System as a "Transparent Box"

# System Modeling: Introductory Concepts

In system modeling, we always start by focusing on the interests of the supersystem. This involves identifying external project roles, their needs, and subjects of interest. Subsequently, we transition to understanding the structure of the system of interest, which we will discuss in this subsection. In the next section, you will learn about the features of modeling creation systems.

## The System as a "Black Box" and a "Transparent Box"

A system is viewed both as a "black box" and a "transparent box."

When seen as a black box, the system is described based on its role behavior, function, subjects of interest, capabilities (requirements), and external project roles. Whether the system is under construction or already operational, you must pay attention to these descriptions:

* How the system functions as a role or functional object and behaves during interaction with its environment.
* How it exists as a constructive object, physically represented and occupying space during its operation.
* Its total cost of ownership.

The transition from describing a system as a "black box" to a "transparent box" involves detailed internal descriptions, a natural progression from the external perspective. For instance, as discussed in section 3, the architect defines the system’s modular structure based on architectural subjects of interest.

## Describing the Internal Structure: The "Transparent Box"

When describing the internal structure of a system, or its "transparent box," our approach may vary. A system can be divided in numerous ways:

* **Functional description:** Focuses on component functions during operation, like describing a teapot as consisting of a pot, spout, fill hole, handle, lid, and steam vent. This describes a role-based system breakdown.
* **Modular (product) description:** Concerns manufacturing aspects, for example, discussing how a teapot's components might be made. This highlights interests in construction and assembly.
* **Spatial description:** Focuses on where a system's components are located, such as whether the lid should be stored on the teapot to save space.
* **Cost description:** Considers the financial and resource expenditures necessary for system parts, contributing to the total cost of ownership viewed as a "black box."

## System Thinking and Descriptions

System thinking involves multiple descriptions of a system. Four key methods of dividing a system into parts are prominent:

1. **Functional=role=analytical**: Analysis helps in understanding a system’s functional parts.
2. **Modular=constructive=synthetic**: Concerns assembly from physical models.
3. **Spatial=location-based**: Relates to component placements.
4. **Cost=economic=resource-based**: Involves economic assessments.

### Creating a System Description

To compile each type of system description, specific practices or methods are employed. For example, managerial accounting methods yield financial descriptions valuable for managers. Be aware that these descriptions might not align perfectly, particularly those based on function versus module. Developers find the system’s primary function and view it functionally, while architects determine the constructive modules needed. Functional and modular parts may not always correspond 1:1, evidenced by the scissors example, where the functional parts are a blade block and handle, while modular parts are halves.

### Functional Analysis and Modular Synthesis

In system projects, functional analysis (dividing into parts) and modular synthesis (assembly) are crucial. Beware of projects lacking clear synthesis decision-making. Analysts often work on these projects, but actual world change stems from synthesis. Hence, those using a systems approach can dissect a system's structure as a "transparent box," identifying key subjects of interest:

- **Functional=role=analytical** analysis helps understand device principles.
- **Modular=constructive=synthetic** assembly is about constructing from models.
- **Spatial=location-based** examines placement within the universe.
- **Cost=economic=resource-based** evaluates financial aspects.

By examining systems from these viewpoints, individuals employing a systems approach better understand and articulate the structure and operation of any system.
