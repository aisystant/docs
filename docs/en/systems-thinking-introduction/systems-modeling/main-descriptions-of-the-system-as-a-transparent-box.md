# Main Descriptions of the System as a "Transparent Box"

In systems modeling, we always begin by considering the area of interest for the supersystem[ ^1 ]—identifying external project roles, their needs, and subjects of interest. Only after this do we proceed to the structure of the system of interest, which we will discuss in this subsection. In the following section, Section 7, you'll learn about the features of modeling creation systems.

The system of interest is viewed both as a "black box" and a "transparent box."

A system as a black box is described through role behavior and function, subjects of interest, capabilities (needs), and external project roles. Whether it's a future system[ ^2 ] or an existing one[ ^3 ], the following descriptions of the system must be taken into account:

- As a functional/role object and its behavior in interaction with the environment during operation;
- As a constructive object, represented in the physical world, occupying space during operation;
- As the total cost of ownership of the system.

Note that these descriptions of the system as a "black box" lead to the description of the system as a "transparent box." The internal description is an inherent consequence of the external. For example, in Section 3, we already discussed the role of the architect who determines the constructive (modular) setup of the system, based on the architectural subjects of interest of the system.

In this subsection, we will discuss how the system's internal structure ("transparent box") is described. The notional "breakdown" of the system into parts can be done in various ways[ ^4 ]. Here are four main types of system breakdowns and corresponding descriptions, using the example of a "teapot" system:

- Someone interested in the functions of parts during operation might say that a teapot consists of a vessel, a spout, a filling hole in the vessel, a handle on the vessel, a lid, a handle on the lid, and a steam release hole in the lid. This is to prevent water from splashing out of the spout when the wet lid is closed. This is a functional description of the teapot system, and the description of subsystems as role (functional) objects is called system breakdown.
- Another person might say that the teapot consists of two parts that need to be manufactured, as their interest lies in the production time of the teapot. Here, the subject of interest is the construction, specifically "what to manufacture" or "how to assemble." This is a modular (product) description of the system.
- A third person might say that the lid and the teapot should be stored together, preferably with the lid directly on the teapot. This concerns placement—"where in the universe the parts of the teapot are located." This is the spatial description of the placement of parts within the system.
- A fourth person might consider the cost of teapot parts, i.e., what will require spending money and resources. This is the cost description, part of the total ownership cost of the system as a "black box."

Systems thinking encompasses multiple system descriptions. However, four main types of descriptions or viewpoints for dividing the system into parts stand out[ ^5 ]. Key decisions on the system's structure are called the system concept. The system concept is typically not created once; it gradually accumulates details until the description accuracy is sufficient for its manufacture on a production platform. Thus, the system concept is "alive" and evolves during development, with the system continually modifying even after the start of its operation.

To compose each of these system descriptions, it is crucial to know a particular practice or description method. Through this method, a specific work artifact is produced. For example, we previously mentioned that by using the managerial accounting description method, one can obtain a financial description of an organization system that interests a manager.

Note that all these descriptions do not coincide with each other. The discrepancy between functional and modular descriptions is particularly hard to notice. Developers generally determine the primary function of a system and view it as a functional object composed of functional subsystems. The architect then identifies which constructive modules (executors) will fulfill these roles. The overlap between functional and modular parts does not necessarily have to be 1 to 1, and the names of these parts can differ. Consider the example of scissors, where the functional parts are the blade unit and handle, while the modular parts are half 1 and half 2.

In system projects, a functional analysis occurs—dividing into parts (analysis means division), and a modular synthesis—assembly. Beware of projects where it's unclear who makes the synthesis decisions. Such projects usually involve analysts, but they do not change the world. Synthesis and synthesis decisions change the world!

Thus, a person using a systems approach can examine the structure of any system as a "transparent box," highlighting at least four subjects of interest:

- Functional=Role=Analytical[ ^6 ];
- Modular=Constructive=Synthetic;
- Spatial=Places=Placement;
- Cost=Economic=Resource.

[ ^1 ]: One of the system thinking skills: the first step of attention is always outward from the boundary of the system of interest, and the second step is inward.
[ ^2 ]: That is, design in terms of modeling what kind of system is needed within the supersystem. This is direct engineering.
[ ^3 ]: Or reverse engineering, i.e., we describe an already functioning system if such a description is unavailable but needed for some reason.
[ ^4 ]: If different people look at a kitten, they will see different things. A vet will see the biological structure of the kitten, while a grandmother will see a warm and fluffy object. A system can be divided by materials used (iron, plastic, glass, etc.), color of the parts (black, white, or colored), or shape of the parts (round, square, etc.).
[ ^5 ]: For example, recently, more interest has been drawn to which work activities are conducted with parts of the system.
[ ^6 ]: Typically, analysis or division into parts is performed to understand the system's design principle. Analysis helps comprehend the functional parts of the system. Synthesis or assembly is associated with assembling the system from physical models. Therefore, functional analysis and modular synthesis are frequently mentioned. Both analysis and synthesis need to be conducted. Engaging in only one is not enough.
