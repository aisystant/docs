# Perform Modeling: 6.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to them, indicate the concepts with which they are most strongly connected in your mind. Other concepts may come from your current *worldviews*, so you don't need to include only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with fellow students, colleagues, or close ones. For example, try explaining these concepts in simple terms, giving examples from your experience, linking different concepts together, or explaining their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
