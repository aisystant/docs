Please list the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and alongside them, write the concepts with which they are most closely related for you. These other concepts can be from your current worldview, meaning you don't necessarily have to include only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or those close to you. For example, you might try explaining these concepts in simple language, provide examples from your experience, connect different concepts together, or discuss their importance.
