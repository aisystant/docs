title: Example Description of the Supersystem's Area of Interest
---

Let's consider an example of a description from cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table.

In marketing, terms such as customer problems or misalignments (unaddressed needs) are often discussed. These are important concepts in entrepreneurial activities, but it's essential to understand how they are connected with systems concepts related to the areas of interest in the supersystem, such as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For instance, a marketer identifies a group of people or agents (like companies) that could potentially assume external project roles related to the client base (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group of people or agents is called the target audience or target group. There are applied marketing practices^[These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and create a client profile. However, these practices will not be discussed in our course.] that allow the description of potential representatives of the target audience. For example, they describe their problems and misalignments, creating a client profile.

Sometimes, people speak about needs that are part of Maslow's hierarchy of needs^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs>]. However, it's important not to confuse the term "need" as used in Maslow's theory—where it pertains to an agent—with its use in systems thinking, where it pertains to a project role. Henceforth, we will refer to Maslow's "needs" as the agent's misalignments (or problems), and use the term "need" only when discussing the needs of external project roles (not the agent).

Agents are described using characteristics such as age, gender^[Although modern marketing theories recommend prioritizing behavioral factors over these characteristics.], place of residence, social status, competencies, education, and available resources (weekly time, finances), among others. These characteristics are crucial for understanding the "intentions" of these individuals. The primary goal of marketing is to have individuals from the target audience assume the role of buyer and subsequently the role of user.

Therefore, it is necessary to separately address:

* the misalignments and problems of individuals from the target audience^[These are specific individuals as representatives of the target audience. People's misalignments are described not only in Maslow's hierarchy. Here are a few more sources: <https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory>, <https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/>. Notice, these sources do not feature any hierarchy.];
* the needs of external project roles, fulfilled by people from this target audience.

Problems and misalignments place (compel, stimulate) individuals into specific project roles, and when they begin to act according to these roles, they have corresponding needs. In different roles, the same people may have entirely different needs.

This example further demonstrates the necessity of carefully considering concepts from different theories, and how using a systems approach helps to quickly understand these concepts and connect them together.
