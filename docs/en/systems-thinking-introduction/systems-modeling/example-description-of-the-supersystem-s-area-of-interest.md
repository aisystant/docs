# Example Description of Supersystem Interest Areas

Let's examine an example of one of the descriptions from cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table.

In marketing, concepts such as customer problems or dissatisfaction (target audience) are often discussed. These are important notions in entrepreneurial activities, but it's crucial to understand how they relate to system concepts relevant to the supersystem's interest areas, such as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For example, a marketer identifies a group of people or agents (e.g., companies) who could potentially fill external project roles related to the client base (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group of people or agents is referred to as the target audience or target group. There are applied marketing practices[^1] that allow for the description of potential representatives of the target audience. For example, they describe their problems and dissatisfaction, and create a client profile.

Sometimes needs that are part of Maslow's hierarchy are discussed. However, it is important not to confuse the word "need" in Maslow's theory context[^2] with its context in systems thinking: the former relates to the agent, while the latter refers to the project role. Further, we'll refer to Maslow's notion of need as the dissatisfaction (or problem) of the agent, and reserve the term "need" for when it specifically refers to the needs of external project roles (not the agent).

Agents are described using characteristics such as age, gender[^3], place of residence, social status, competencies and education, available resources (weekly time, finances), etc. These characteristics are essential for understanding the "intention" of these individuals. The main task of marketing is to ensure that people from the target audience assume the role of buyer, and subsequently the role of user.

Therefore, it's necessary to separately address:

* the dissatisfaction and problems of people from the target audience[^4];
* the needs of external project roles which are played by people from this target audience.

Problems and dissatisfaction place (encourage, motivate) individuals into specific project roles, and when they begin to act according to these project roles, they have corresponding needs. In other roles, the same individuals may have entirely different needs.

This example further illustrates the importance of carefully considering concepts from different theories, and how systems thinking aids in quickly understanding these concepts and linking them together.

[^1]: These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and compile a client profile. However, these applied practices will not be discussed in our course.
[^2]: [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).
[^3]: Although modern marketing theories recommend focusing less on such characteristics and more on behavioral factors of agents.
[^4]: Specific people as representatives of the target audience. People's dissatisfaction is not only described in Maslow's hierarchy. Here are a few more sources: [CNVC Needs Inventory](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory), [BayNVC List of Needs](https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/). Note that there is no pyramid present there.
