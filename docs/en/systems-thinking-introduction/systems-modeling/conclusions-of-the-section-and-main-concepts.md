# Conclusions of the Section and Key Concepts

Systems modeling is the process of creating descriptions of a system that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within the system, as well as the system's interaction with its external surroundings. Modeling involves describing only what is essential and omitting what is not. Documenting models allows the team to keep essential elements in focus, whereas non-essential elements remain only in conversations.

Role-based descriptions, which collectively form the system description, are created using descriptive methods. Most of you engage in modeling and creating documentation for various systems. Therefore, it is important to understand the descriptive methods you use. You need to improve in these areas. This constitutes applied mastery. Systems thinking, in particular, will help you pay attention to these methods and integrate them, if necessary, into the project activities of your department or the entire company.

There can be numerous system descriptions, and systems can be described as either "black boxes" or "transparent boxes." One of the important descriptions of the external behavior of a system is the usage concept. When discussing the internal structure of a system, we identify four main descriptions: functional, modular, spatial (placement), and financial (resource).

High-level modeling within project activities includes identifying all important systems and subsystems and understanding their interconnections. In each cell of the 3x3 Table, specific documents with descriptions across different areas of interest can be highlighted.

Key concepts: system description; modeling, descriptive method, subject of interest; model, metamodel, multimodel, mega-model; functional=role-based=analytical; modular=structural=synthetic; spatial=place=placement; cost=economic=resource; functional description, modular description, spatial description.
