# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

Systems modeling is the process of creating system descriptions that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within a system, as well as the system's interaction with its external environment. Modeling involves highlighting only the most important aspects while disregarding the less important ones. Documenting models ensures that the important details remain the focus of the whole team, whereas the less important ones are left to be addressed in conversations.

Role descriptions, which together make up the system description, are created through a description method. Most of you are engaged in modeling and creating system documentation. Therefore, it is important to understand which description methods you use. Improving in them is essential. This is what applied mastery is all about. Systems thinking, in particular, will help you pay attention to these methods and integrate them into your project activities, whether it's for your organizational unit or the entire company.

There can be numerous system descriptions, allowing one to describe a system as either a "black box" or a "transparent box." One of the important descriptions of external system behavior is the usage concept. When discussing the internal structure of a system, we identify four main descriptionsâ€”functional, modular, spatial (places), and financial (resource).

High-level modeling in project activities includes identifying all significant systems and subsystems, as well as understanding their interconnections. In each cell of the 3x3 Table, specific documents with descriptions for different subjects of interest can be identified.
