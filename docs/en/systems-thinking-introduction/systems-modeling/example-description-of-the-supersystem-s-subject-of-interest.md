# Example of Describing the Area of Interest of Supersystems

Let's look at an example of a description from cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table.

In marketing, concepts such as problems or customer dissatisfaction (target audience) are often discussed. These are important concepts in entrepreneurial activities, but it is necessary to understand how they are connected with system concepts in the area of interest of the supersystem, such as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For instance, a marketer identifies a group of people or agents (such as companies) who can potentially take on external project roles related to the client base (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group of people or agents is referred to as the target audience or target group. There are applied marketing practices^[These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and create a client profile. However, we will not discuss such applied practices in the course.] that allow for the description of potential representatives of the target audience, including their problems and dissatisfaction, to create a client profile.

Sometimes, the discussion involves needs that are part of Maslow's hierarchy. However, it is important not to confuse the word "need" in the context of Maslow's theory^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs>] with its use in systems thinking: the former pertains to an agent, while the latter relates to a project role. Henceforth, we will refer to Maslow's needs as the dissatisfaction (or problem) of an agent, and reserve the term "need" exclusively for the needs of external project roles (not the agent).

To describe agents, characteristics such as age, gender^[Although modern marketing theories advise against focusing on such characteristics, recommending a focus on the behavioral factors of agents instead.], place of residence, social status, competencies and education, available resources (time per week, finances), and so on, are used. These characteristics are necessary to understand the "intention" of these individuals. The primary goal of marketing is to ensure that people in the target audience assume the role of buyer, and subsequently, the role of user.

Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish separately:

* the dissatisfaction and problems of people from the target audience^[Specifically with individuals as representatives of the target audience. Human dissatisfaction is described not only in Maslow's hierarchy. Here are a few more sources: <https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory>, <https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/>. Notice that there is no pyramid there.];
* the needs of external project roles played by individuals from this target audience.

Problems and dissatisfaction place (compel, stimulate) people into specific project roles, and when they start acting according to these project roles, they have corresponding needs. In other roles, the same people may have entirely different needs.

This example once again demonstrates that it is necessary to carefully consider concepts from different theories, and that systems thinking helps quickly understand these concepts and connect them with one another.
