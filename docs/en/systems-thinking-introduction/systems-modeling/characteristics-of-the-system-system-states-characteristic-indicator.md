# Characteristics of a System, System States, and Indicators of Characteristics

Following previous posts, I will reflect on the relationship between the concepts of system characteristics (or subject of interest), system state, and characteristic indicators. Although these are covered in systems thinking courses, confusion often arises in practice.

**A system characteristic is a stable, long-term attribute that defines how the system functions as a whole.** For example, load capacity, manageability, reliability, efficiency, and scalability are universal characteristics that describe the behavior of various systems—such as vehicles, organizations, or software products. However, each type of system also has unique characteristics. These characteristics do not change instantly and set the boundaries of possible system states or abilities to perform specific functions (play roles).

For vehicles, load capacity or manageability determines what functions they can perform. A vehicle with high off-road capability might play the role of a tow truck; a vehicle with a spacious body might play the role of a cargo truck; and one with a large interior could even serve as a living space. Focusing on system characteristics helps in choosing the right system model depending on the task. For instance, if people need to be transported, the priority is safety, durability, and so on. If racing is the goal, the focus will be on speed, acceleration, and aerodynamics.

In contrast, **a system state is a time-varying configuration of the system during its operation.** It reflects the current situation and changes under the influence of internal and external factors. For example, a vehicle can be in a state of motion, parking, braking, emergency, overheating, or towing. The vehicle itself remains the same (with the same characteristics and functions), but its states differ at different times during operation.

If a vehicle is stuck in the mud and being towed, it temporarily cannot perform its primary role as a means of transportation. This is another example of how a system state affects its ability to carry out its inherent functions. Unlike system characteristics, which indicate an agent's overall ability to execute specific functions, system states more closely indicate the current capability to perform well-defined roles.

Controlling states is key to a system's operation. For example, engine temperature, oil level, and tire traction are indicators of a vehicle's state, which help in making operational decisions. If tire traction worsens due to ice, the driver adapts their driving style. If the engine overheats, they need to either stop or reduce the load.

In addition to system characteristics and states, it's essential to consider the concept of a **"characteristic indicator."** This refers to the specific quantitative value of a characteristic in a particular system state. For example, a vehicle may have the characteristic of maneuverability, but in the state of "driving on ice," its indicator might be 50%, whereas in the state of "driving on a dry road," it could be 90%. This explains why the same system can show different levels of efficiency under different conditions. For instance, a person may have high endurance, but if they are sleep-deprived, their capacity for sustained effort will be reduced.

The concept of "indicator" can be used to connect the "value of a characteristic" and the "unit of measurement." In this context:

* Characteristic — a general property of the system (e.g., speed, mass, temperature).
* Indicator — the characteristic expressed by a certain value and measured in a specified unit (e.g., 90 km/h, 50 kg, 36.6 °C, though it is not always a numerical value).
* Unit of Measurement — the standard in which the indicator is expressed (e.g., km/h, kg, °C).
* Indicator Value — the numerical value of the characteristic in the given unit of measurement (e.g., 90, 50, 36.6).

Let's examine several examples:

1. Vehicle:

* Characteristic: speed
* Indicator: 90 km/h
* Indicator Value: 90
* Unit of Measurement: km/h

2. Person:

+ Characteristic: body temperature
+ Indicator: 36.6 °C
+ Indicator Value: 36.6
+ Unit of Measurement: °C

3. Phone:

- Characteristic: memory capacity
- Indicator: 256 GB
- Indicator Value: 256
- Unit of Measurement: GB

Quite often, an indicator is a characteristic expressed in numerical terms associated with a unit of measurement. However, some characteristics can have qualitative, not quantitative, indicators. For example, body type — sedan, hatchback, SUV; fuel type — gasoline, diesel, electricity.

Thus, system characteristics are its long-term properties that determine its potential capabilities. A system state is its current configuration, dependent on various conditions and capable of rapid change. A characteristic indicator is a measurable quantity that reflects how prominently a characteristic is manifested in a given state.
