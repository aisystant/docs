# Conduct Modeling: 6.2. Role, System, Subject of Interest, Description Method, and Work Artifact

Review the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. You might not always know the exact name of the description method, so articulate its main characteristic (action). If necessary, use ChatGPT and Google for this purpose. As you progress through the course, it will be beneficial to expand your work (activity) horizons, specifically by learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts in various fields. Note that you may possess a strong activity horizon in medicine, but might be less familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. Formulate notes for further elaboration as needed. You can also leave feedback for course developers in the "Notes" section.

Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
