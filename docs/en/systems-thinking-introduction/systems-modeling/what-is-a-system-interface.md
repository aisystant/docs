# What is a System Interface?

Imagine you want to charge your phone, but the charger and the smartphone have different connectors. Or you get into a new car and can't immediately figure out how to turn on the headlights. Why does this happen? It's all about the interface!

When we interact with any system, we don't see its internal workings—it appears to us as a black box. But for the system to function, it must have clear interaction points. These points are defined through interfaces. When describing a system as a black box, we're only interested in how the system interacts with the outside world without delving into its internal structure.

An interface is a description of the rules and standards of a system's interaction with the external world. It exists as a mental or informational concept and does not have a physical embodiment. However, for interaction to actually occur, an interface module is needed—a physical object that implements the interface. The interface defines how interaction should take place, while the interface module ensures the physical execution of these rules.

An interface is part of a system's description but not the system itself. It determines how data can be input into the system, how to obtain the results of its operation, and what input and output restrictions exist.

Example: A car as a system. In this system, the interface is the description of the rules of interaction between the driver and the car. It specifies the actions the driver must take to convey commands to the car. For instance, the car's control interface includes the rule: "turning the steering direction control alters the course," "pressing the acceleration control increases speed," "activating the start control engages the engine." In turn, the interface module is a physical object that implements the described interface. In a car, such modules include the steering wheel (steering control device), accelerator pedal (acceleration control device), and engine start button. Here, the black box concept illustrates that the driver does not see how the car functions or how the engine converts fuel into movement, but through interface modules, interacts with the system, i.e., operates the car.

In this example, the following interfaces and their modules can be distinguished:

- Physical Interface: The rules for interacting with mechanical control elements, interface modules include pedals, the steering wheel, and buttons on the dashboard.
- Informational Interface: The rules for providing the driver with data about the car's condition, interface modules include the speedometer, fuel indicators, and dashboard display.
- Energy Interface: The description of the rules for supplying energy to the car, interface modules include the fuel tank and charging port for electric vehicles.
- Voice Interface: The rules for voice interaction with the car, interface modules include the microphone, voice processor, and sound system.

If every car had a unique control interface, drivers would need to relearn before each trip. It is the standardization of interfaces that makes driving straightforward and universal.

Thus, we can conclude as follows. An interface is an intangible concept that describes the rules of a system’s interaction with the external world. An interface module is a physical component that implements the interface. The interface is part of the system's description as a black box but not the system itself. Without interfaces, systems cannot interact with each other or users. We live in a world of interfaces—from cars and gadgets to language and social interactions. The better the interface is designed, the easier and more convenient it is to work with the system!
