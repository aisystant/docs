# What is a System Interface?

Imagine you want to charge your phone, but the charger and smartphone have different ports. Or you get into a new car and can't immediately figure out how to turn on the headlights. Why does this happen? It's all about the interface!

When we interact with any system, we don't see its internal workings—it appears to us as a black box. However, to make the system function, there must be clear interaction points, defined through interfaces. When describing a system as a black box, we are only concerned with how the system interacts with the external world, without delving into its internal mechanisms.

An interface is a description of the rules and standards for the system's interaction with the external world. It exists as a mental or informational concept and does not have a physical embodiment. However, for interaction to actually occur, an interface module is needed—a physical object that implements the interface. The interface defines how the interaction should take place, while the interface module ensures the physical execution of these rules.

An interface is a part of the system's description, but not the system itself. It defines how data can be input into the system, how to obtain the results of its work, and what constraints exist on input and output.

Example: A car as a system. In this system, the interface is the description of the rules for driver interaction with the car. It defines what actions the driver must perform to convey commands to the vehicle. For instance, the car's control interface includes rules such as: "turning the steering device changes the direction of travel," "pressing the acceleration device increases speed," "activating the start device engages the engine." In turn, the interface module is the physical object implementing the described interface. In a car, such modules include the steering wheel (steering device), the gas pedal (acceleration device), and the engine start button. Here, the black box concept explains that the driver does not see how the car operates or how the engine converts fuel into motion but interacts with the system—managing the car—through the interface modules.

In this example, the following interfaces and their interface modules can be identified:

– Physical interface: rules for interacting with mechanical control elements; interface modules include pedals, steering wheel, and buttons on the dashboard;
– Informational interface: rules for providing the driver with data about the car's condition; interface modules include the speedometer, fuel indicators, and dashboard display;
– Energy interface: description of the rules for supplying energy to the car; interface modules include the fuel tank and charging port of an electric vehicle;
– Voice interface: rules for vocal interaction with the car; interface modules are the microphone, voice processor, and sound system.

If each car had a unique control interface, drivers would have to relearn before each trip. This is why the standardization of interfaces makes driving straightforward and universal.

Thus, we can conclude the following summary: An interface is an immaterial concept describing the rules of a system's interaction with the external world. An interface module is the physical component that implements the interface. The interface is part of the system's description as a black box but not the system itself. Without interfaces, systems cannot interact with each other or with users. We live in a world of interfaces—from cars and gadgets to language and social interactions. The better the interface is designed, the easier and more convenient it is to work with the system!
