# System Characteristics, System States, and Characteristic Indicators

In continuation of these posts, I will reflect on the set of concepts: system characteristic (or subject of interest), system state, and characteristic indicator. Although these are typically covered in systems thinking courses, confusion often arises in practice.

**A system characteristic is a stable, long-term property that defines how a system functions overall**. For example, load capacity, maneuverability, reliability, efficiency, and scalability are universal characteristics that describe the behaviors of different systems—whether it's a vehicle, organization, or software product. However, each type of system also has unique characteristics. These characteristics do not change instantly and establish the boundaries of possible system states or its ability to perform certain functions (play roles).

For instance, speaking about a vehicle, its load capacity or maneuverability determines what functions it can perform. A vehicle with high off-road capability can play the role of a tow truck, one with a spacious body can serve as a truck, and another with a large cabin may even function as a dwelling. Focusing on system characteristics helps choose the right system model depending on the tasks. For example, if the goal is to transport people, the priority is on safety, durability, etc. If the goal is to win races, focus will be on speed, acceleration, and aerodynamics.

Unlike characteristics, **a system state is a time-variant configuration of the system during its operation.** It reflects the current situation and changes under the influence of internal and external factors. For example, a car can be in a state of motion, parking, braking, emergency state, overheating, or towing. The car remains the same (the same characteristics and function), but at different times during operation, its states differ.

If a car is stuck in the mud and being towed, it temporarily cannot fulfill its primary role as a transportation unit. This is another example of how a system's state affects its ability to perform its inherent functions. However, unlike a system's characteristics, which speak to an agent's overall ability to perform certain functions, system states are more about the current capability to perform known roles.

Controlling states plays a key role in a system's operation. For instance, the engine temperature, oil level, and wheel-road adhesion are indicators of the car's state, helping make operational decisions in real time. If the wheel-road adhesion deteriorates due to ice, the driver adapts their driving style. If the engine overheats, it requires either stopping or reducing the load.

In addition to system characteristics and states, it is also necessary to consider the concept of a **"characteristic indicator."** This is a concrete quantitative value of a characteristic in a specific system state. For example, a car has the characteristic of maneuverability, but in the state "driving on ice," its indicator might be 50%, while in the state "driving on a dry road," it could be 90%. This explains why the same system can demonstrate different levels of efficiency under various conditions. For instance, a person might have high endurance, but if they haven't slept well, their ability to handle prolonged tasks is lower.

The concept of "indicator" can be used to link the "value of a characteristic" and the "unit of measurement." In this case:

* Characteristic – the general property of the system (e.g., speed, mass, temperature).
* Indicator – the characteristic expressed in a given value and measured in a specific unit (e.g., 90 km/h, 50 kg, 36.6 °C, although not always a numerical value).
* Unit of measurement – the standard in which the indicator is expressed (e.g., km/h, kg, °C).
* Indicator value – the numerical value of the characteristic in the given unit of measurement (e.g., 90, 50, 36.6).

Let's look at a few examples:

1. Car:

* Characteristic: speed
* Indicator: 90 km/h
* Indicator value: 90
* Unit of measurement: km/h

2. Person:

+ Characteristic: body temperature
+ Indicator: 36.6 °C
+ Indicator value: 36.6
+ Unit of measurement: °C

3. Phone:

- Characteristic: memory capacity
- Indicator: 256 GB
- Indicator value: 256
- Unit of measurement: GB

Quite often, an indicator is a characteristic expressed in a numerical value tied to a unit of measurement. However, some characteristics may have qualitative rather than quantitative indicators. For example, body type—sedan, hatchback, SUV; fuel type—gasoline, diesel, electricity.

Thus, system characteristics are its long-term properties that determine its potential capabilities. The system state is its current configuration, dependent on various conditions and able to change rapidly. The characteristic indicator is a measurable value that reflects how much a characteristic is manifested in a given state.
