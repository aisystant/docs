title: System Characteristics, System States, Characteristic Indicator
---

In continuation of these posts, I will reflect on the interconnected concepts of system characteristics (or subject of interest), system state, and characteristic indicators. While these are typically addressed in systems thinking courses, confusion often arises in practice.

**System characteristic is a stable, long-term property that determines how the system functions as a whole.** For instance, load capacity, controllability, reliability, efficiency, and scalability are universal characteristics that describe the behavior of different systems—be it a vehicle, an organization, or a software product. Yet, each type of system also has unique characteristics. These characteristics do not change instantly and set the boundaries of possible system states or abilities to perform certain functions (play roles).

When discussing a vehicle, its load capacity or controllability determines which functions it can perform. A vehicle with high off-road capabilities can play the role of a tug, one with a large cargo bed can serve as a truck, and one with a spacious interior might even function as a dwelling. Focusing on system characteristics helps in selecting the suitable system model depending on the tasks. For example, if transporting people is needed, safety and durability become priorities. If winning races is the goal, then attention will be on speed, acceleration, and aerodynamics.

In contrast, **system state is the configuration of a system that changes over time during its operation.** It reflects the current scenario and can change due to internal and external factors. For example, a car may be in a state of movement, parking, braking, emergency, overheating, or towing. The car itself remains the same (with the same characteristics and functions), but its states vary over time while in use.

If a car gets stuck in mud and is being towed, it temporarily cannot fulfill its primary role as a means of transportation. This illustrates how the system state influences its ability to perform its inherent functions. However, unlike system characteristics, which speak to an agent's overall ability to perform specific functions, system states are more about its current ability to fulfill understood roles.

Controlling states plays a key role in system operation. For example, engine temperature, oil level, and tire-road grip are indicators of a car’s state that help make real-time decisions. If tire grip worsens due to ice, the driver will adapt their driving style. If the engine overheats, it becomes necessary to either stop or reduce the load.

Besides system characteristics and states, it is essential to consider the concept of a **“characteristic indicator.”** This is a specific quantitative value of a characteristic in a particular system state. For instance, a car might have a maneuverability characteristic, but in the "ice driving" state, its indicator might be 50%, whereas on a dry road, it could be 90%. This explains why the same system can demonstrate different levels of efficiency under varying conditions. For example, a person may generally have high stamina, but if they haven’t slept well, their capacity for prolonged exertion will be lower.

The concept of an “indicator” can be used to connect the “value of a characteristic” and “unit of measurement.” In such cases:

* Characteristic – a general property of the system (for example, speed, mass, temperature).
* Indicator – a characteristic expressed with a value and measured in a specific unit (for example, 90 km/h, 50 kg, 36.6 °C, though it's not always a numerical value).
* Unit of measurement – the standard in which the indicator is expressed (for example, km/h, kg, °C).
* Indicator value – the numerical value of the characteristic in a specified unit of measurement (for example, 90, 50, 36.6).

Let’s review some examples:

1. Automobile:

* Characteristic: speed
* Indicator: 90 km/h
* Indicator value: 90
* Unit of measurement: km/h

2. Human

+ Characteristic: body temperature
+ Indicator: 36.6 °C
+ Indicator value: 36.6
+ Unit of measurement: °C

3. Telephone

- Characteristic: memory capacity
- Indicator: 256 GB
- Indicator value: 256
- Unit of measurement: GB

Quite often, an indicator is a characteristic expressed in a numerical value associated with a unit of measurement. However, some characteristics may have qualitative rather than quantitative indicators. For instance, body type—sedan, hatchback, off-road vehicle; fuel type—gasoline, diesel, electricity.

Thus, system characteristics are its long-term properties determining its potential capabilities. The system state is its current configuration, dependent on various conditions and capable of rapid change. A characteristic indicator is a measurable quantity reflecting how much a characteristic manifests in a given state.
