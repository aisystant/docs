title: 'Perform Modeling: 6.7. Functional and Structural Descriptions'
---

This is an example of descriptions for the areas of interest of a system of interest.

Review the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the difference between functional parts and product (modular) parts. If necessary, use the AI bot Aisystant. Fill in the empty cells following the example in the first row. If you lack the perspective to select the appropriate words and labels (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Provide five examples of various functional and structural breakdowns of systems (similar to scissors).

Provide examples from both work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its sections.
