# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 6.7. Functional and Structural Descriptions

This is one of the examples of descriptions in the area of interest of the system of interest.

Review the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the distinction between functional parts and product (modular) parts; use the AI bot Aisystant if necessary. Fill in the empty cells following the example in the first row. If you lack the perspective to choose the right words and labels, feel free to use ChatGPT or Google. Provide five examples of different (like those of scissors) functional and structural breakdowns of certain systems.

Provide examples from work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its components.
