# Perform the Modeling: 6.7. Functional and Structural Descriptions

This is one example of describing the fields of interest within the system of interest.

Review the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the difference between the concepts of the functional part and product (modular) parts. If necessary, use the AI-bot at Aisystant. Fill in the empty cells following the example in the first row. If you lack the perspective to find the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Provide five examples of various functional and structural breakdowns of systems (like scissors).

Provide examples from work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
