# Connection Between the Description Method, Subject of Interest, Project Roles, and the System

In previous sections, it was mentioned that the subject of interest is connected with the system. A system can be characterized by various subjects of interest. These subjects are tied to project roles, meaning that people in roles are interested in certain system characteristics.

The team determines which interests of project roles [^1] will be addressed during the system's creation. Accordingly, this influences the necessary work artifacts (documentation). Work artifacts are physical carriers that contain a description of the system related to a specific subject of interest.

To create documentation, one must master certain practices [^2] or description methods. Through this method, a description of the system is created on a physical medium, addressing the subject of interest in the system.

For example, a racer's interest lies in the speed of the race car. This can be expressed differently: the external project role "racer" has the subject of interest "speed" in the system "race car". Developers decided to meet the racer's interests, meaning the team deemed that the interests of this project role should be satisfied. This implies that they will continue working on this subject of interest, during which documentation (a computer model) will be created.

Next, developers choose a description method to make a system description. They select one of the description methods that allows for building a computer model to calculate the car's speed [^3]. This computer model is a work artifact containing the system's description concerning the subject of interest, speed.

Incidentally, this model may address not only this subject of interest but also others. The total number of work artifacts (documentation) relating to system descriptions is proportional to the number of subjects of interest, and the number of subjects of interest is proportional to the number of project roles the team decides to satisfy [^4]. 

[ ^1 ]: Selected project roles' subjects of interest and/or preferences that will be addressed. It is impossible to satisfy all interests due to limited resources (funds and time), but on the other hand, the team should not make a fatal mistake. A fatal mistake could be not considering a particular interest, leading to significant and irreparable costs later.

[ ^2 ]: As you recall, a project role creates a work artifact through practice.

[ ^3 ]: Here, both the theoretical part of the calculations and the computer part of how these calculations can be conducted are important.

[ ^4 ]: As you remember, all project roles are considered, but the team may decide that only selected ones will be satisfied. For each one, a work artifact is created to satisfy the project role. The diagram only presents an external project role, but the same applies to an internal project role.
