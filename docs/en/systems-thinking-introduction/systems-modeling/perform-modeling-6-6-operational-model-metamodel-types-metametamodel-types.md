# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 6.6. Operational Model, Meta-Model Types, Meta-Meta-Model Types

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Note that the data presented might apply to various situations—you're only required to describe one scenario. The key is to avoid obvious mistakes in methodology.

Provide examples of chains related to meta-modeling for objects within your project, following the format in the first row. Do not worry too much about distinguishing between functional and structural objects and their types. It is important that you differentiate between a real object from the physical world of the project, its type from the discipline in the project's subject area, and the type of discipline from the intellect stack (from our coursebook)—and beyond distinguishing them, also understand their alignment.

Locate the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its sections.
