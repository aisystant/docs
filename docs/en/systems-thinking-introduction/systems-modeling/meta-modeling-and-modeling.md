# Meta-Modeling and Modeling

In this textbook, meta-meta-models are introduced. For instance, "system" is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are specifically studied in transdisciplines. Then you delve into a specific subject area, where there are meta-models. For example, in education, the system of interest is the concept of mastery, while in the transportation sector, it is a vehicle. Specifically, this can refer to mastery of compilation (or accounting mastery) and passenger vehicle, respectively.

Next, we create a model — such as a description of John Doe's mastery or a model of a BMW X6. The specific mastery (not the concept) of John Doe or the particular BMW X6 vehicle is the actual system (physical object). This is referred to as the system of interest (a term from the meta-meta-model).

These concepts are not only used in systems thinking. Our language is structured similarly. For instance, we could say that the concept of "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The concept "mother" is a meta-meta-model used to identify a living creature that has children.

In a zoo, the term "mother of a cub" is used — a meta-model from the animal kingdom domain (not human). A meta-model could also be "mother of tiger cubs."

A record in the zoo's database — "Maya the tigress, mother of her cub Murzik" — is a model. A photograph of Maya the tigress or a sculpture of Maya the tigress is also a model.

The tigress Maya, who has become a mother, is a physical 4D-object in the zoo. Maya the tigress is a "mother of a cub" and a "mother." But not all "mothers" are "mothers of a cub," and not all "mothers of a cub" are Maya the tigress.

All of this is covered in the course "Rational Work," then applied in systems thinking. You can already distinguish between systems and processes, roles and executors, models and meta-models, and so on. To better train systems thinking, we recommend using our course as a simulator (engaging in modeling), which helps gain expertise and get accustomed to modeling [ ^1 ].

We previously mentioned that setting up systems thinking begins with studying system concepts [ ^2 ]. Now you are more consciously focusing on modeling techniques, and will later engage in meta-modeling. Meta-modeling involves creating templates for tables, defining the names of rows and/or columns of the table (the properties of the table). This is the kind of work carried out by course developers to create universal tables, and as Chief Transformation Officers, you will create similar tables for your employees on your work projects [ ^3 ]. Meanwhile, you are engaged in modeling, filling out the course tables [ ^4 ]. But for this, you need to know the subject area, as the tables reflect specific work activities and apply concepts of applied methods.

Therefore, to set up systems thinking, it is necessary to study the systems language, modeling, and meta-modeling. We recommend doing this by thinking through writing and working with tables, not with diagrams: filling out and creating tables based on your work projects. Hence, use your work time for modeling and meta-modeling, as it's impossible to learn to drive a car on a training ground — so students are almost immediately sent out to the city roads. Therefore, use modeling tools (like Coda or at least our course as a simulator) directly in your work conditions.

[ ^1 ]: Systems thinking, in terms of form, manifests as "thinking through writing" or "thinking through modeling." Modeling or filling out tables in the course is the next step towards establishing systems thinking (after studying system concepts).

[ ^2 ]: Including understanding their interconnections.

[ ^3 ]: You may use some tables from the course, but you can also create your own unique tables with concepts from your applied field.

[ ^4 ]: Beautiful diagrams of squares and arrows are the popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables, and even texts, are more appropriate and systemic for complex projects and systems.
