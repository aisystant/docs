# Meta-Modeling and Modeling

In our textbook, meta-meta-models are introduced. For example, the concept of a "system" is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are specifically studied in transdisciplines. You then dive into a subject area where there are meta-models. For instance, in education, the system of interest is the concept of mastery, while in the transportation sector, it's a vehicle. To clarify, this might be described as mastery of organization (or bookkeeping mastery) and a passenger vehicle.

Next, we create a model—like a description of John's mastery or a model of a BMW X6. But John's specific mastery (not the concept) or the specific BMW X6 becomes the system itself (the physical object). This is also referred to as the system of interest (a term from the meta-meta-model).

Such concepts are not exclusive to systems thinking. This structure is also how our language is organized. For instance, we can say that the concept of "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The concept of "mother" serves as a meta-meta-model to identify a living being that has children.

In a zoo, the term "mother of the offspring" is used as a meta-model in the domain of the animal world (not the human world). A meta-model might also be "mother of cubs."

A zoo database entry like “Maya the tigress, mother of her cub Murzik” is a model. A photograph of Maya the tigress or a sculpture of her is also a model.

The tigress Maya, who became a mother, is a physical 4D object in the zoo. Maya the tigress is the "mother of the offspring" and "mother." However, not all "mothers" are "mothers of offspring," and not all "mothers of offspring" are Maya the tigress.

All of this is covered in the “Rational Work” course and subsequently applied in systems thinking. You already can differentiate between systems and processes, roles and executors, models and meta-models, etc. To further train your systems thinking, we recommend using our course as a simulator (engaging in modeling), which helps you get used to and proficient in modeling [ ^1 ].

We previously discussed that the foundation of systems thinking begins with the study of systems concepts [ ^2 ]. Now, you are more consciously paying attention to modeling techniques and will later engage in meta-modeling. Meta-modeling involves creating table templates, which means determining the names of the rows and/or columns of a table (table properties). This work was done by the course developers to create universal tables, and as Chief Transformation Officers, you will create similar tables for your employees on your work projects [ ^3 ]. For now, you are working on modeling, which means filling in the course tables [ ^4 ]. However, for this, you need to know the subject area, as the tables reflect specific work activities and use the concepts of applied methods.

Thus, to develop systems thinking, it is necessary to study the systems language, modeling, and meta-modeling. We recommend doing this through thinking through writing and working with tables rather than diagrams: filling in and creating tables for your work projects. Therefore, use your working time for modeling and meta-modeling because you cannot learn to drive a passenger vehicle on a driving range—that's why students are almost immediately sent to city roads. So use modeling tools (i.e., Coda or at least our course as a simulator) right away in your work conditions.

[ ^1 ]: Systems thinking from a form perspective is expressed as “thinking through writing” or “thinking through modeling.” The modeling tasks or table completions in the course are the next step towards establishing systems thinking (after studying systems concepts).
[ ^2 ]: Including understanding their interconnections.
[ ^3 ]: Some tables you will take from the course, but you can also create your unique tables with the concepts of the applied field.
[ ^4 ]: Beautiful diagrams of squares and arrows are a popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables and even texts are more appropriate and systems-oriented for complex projects and systems.
