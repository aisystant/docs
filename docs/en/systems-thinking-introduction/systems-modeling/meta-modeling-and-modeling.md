# Meta-Modeling and Modeling

# Meta-Meta-Models in Our Course

In our course, we establish meta-meta-models. For example, the concept of a **system** is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are studied specifically in transdisciplines. You then delve into a subject area where there are meta-models. For example, in education, the system of interest is the concept of mastery, while in the transportation industry, it is a transport vehicle. To clarify, this can relate to thinking mastery (or accounting mastery) and a passenger vehicle.

Next, we create a model—like a description of John's mastery or a model of the BMW X6. The actual mastery (not the concept) of John or the specific BMW X6 vehicle represents the system itself (the physical object). This is referred to as the system of interest (a term from the meta-meta-model).

These concepts are used not only in systems thinking. The structure of our language mirrors this principle. For example, we could say the concept of “mother” is a meta-meta-model. The concept “mother” functions as a meta-meta-model to identify the living being who has children.

In the zoo, the notion of “mother of an offspring” is a meta-model from the animal domain (not human). A meta-model could also be “mother of tiger cubs.”

An entry in the zoo's database—“Maya the tigress, mother of her cub Murzik”—is a model. A photograph or a sculpture of Maya the tigress is also a model.

The tigress Maya herself, who has become a mother, is a physical 4D object in the zoo. Maya represents a “mother of an offspring” and “mother.” However, not every “mother” is a “mother of an offspring,” and not all “mothers of an offspring” are the tigress Maya.

# Applying Systems Thinking in “Rational Work”

All of this is covered in the course "Rational Work," and is then used in systems thinking. You are now capable of differentiating systems and processes, roles and executors, models and meta-models, and so on. For optimal systems thinking training, it’s recommended that you use our course as a simulator (engage in modeling) to enhance your skills and adapt to modeling^[Systems thinking, in terms of form, manifests as “thinking through writing” or “thinking by modeling.” Exercises in modeling or completing tables in the course represent the next step toward establishing systems thinking (following the study of system concepts).].

Earlier, we mentioned that establishing systems thinking begins with studying system concepts^[Including understanding their interconnections.]. You are now consciously focusing on modeling techniques, and you will subsequently engage in meta-modeling. Meta-modeling involves creating table templates, defining the names of rows and/or columns (properties of the table). This is the task undertaken by the course developers to devise universal tables, and when you become Chief Transformation Officers, you will create similar tables for your employees based on your work projects^[Some tables you will take from the course, but you can also design unique tables with concepts from your applied field.]. For now, you are engaged in modeling, filling tables in the course^[Beautiful diagrams with squares and arrows are a popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables and even texts are more adequate and systematic for complex projects and systems.]. However, you need to know the subject area since the tables reflect specific work activities and use concepts of applied methods.

Thus, to establish systems thinking, studying the systems language, modeling, and meta-modeling is essential. We recommend doing this through thinking through writing and working with tables rather than diagrams: filling out and creating tables for your work projects. Use your working time for modeling and meta-modeling, as you cannot learn to drive on a training ground alone—this is why students are almost immediately sent to city streets. Therefore, employ the modeling tool (Coda, or at the very least our course as a simulator) directly in your work conditions.
