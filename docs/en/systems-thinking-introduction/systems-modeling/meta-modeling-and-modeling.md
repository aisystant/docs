# Meta-Modeling and Modeling

In our textbook, we introduce meta-meta-models. For example, the concept of a "system" is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are studied specifically in transdisciplines. After that, you move down into a subject area, which contains meta-models. For instance, in education, the system of interest is the concept of mastery, while in the transportation sector, it is a transportation vehicle. To be more specific, this could mean mastery of organization (or mastery of accounting) and a passenger vehicle, respectively.

Next, we create a model—such as a description of John Doe’s mastery or a model of a BMW X6 vehicle. The actual mastery (not the concept) of John Doe or a specific BMW X6 vehicle is the system itself (a physical object). This is also referred to as the system of interest (a term from the meta-meta-model).

These concepts are not exclusive to systems thinking. Our language is structured in the same way. For example, we can say that the concept of "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The concept of "mother" serves as a meta-meta-model for identifying a living being that has children.

In a zoo, the concept "mother of an animal cub" is used—this is a meta-model from the subject area of the animal world (not the human world). A meta-model could also be "mother of tiger cubs."

A record in the zoo’s database—“Maya the tigress, mother of her cub Murzik”—is a model. A photograph of Maya the tigress or a figurine of Maya the tigress is also a model.

Maya the tigress herself, who became a mother, is a physical 4D object in the zoo. Maya the tigress is both a "mother of an animal cub" and a "mother." But not all "mothers" are "mothers of animal cubs," and not all "mothers of animal cubs" are Maya the tigress.

All of this is covered in the “Rational Work” course, and later applied in systems thinking. You are already able to distinguish between systems and processes, roles and performers, models and meta-models, and so on. To better train your systems thinking, we recommend using our course as a simulator (by practicing modeling), which helps you get hands-on experience and become accustomed to modeling^[From a systems thinking perspective, this is expressed as “thinking through writing” or “thinking through modeling.” The modeling or table-filling exercises in the course are the next step toward developing systems thinking (after studying systems concepts).].

Earlier, we mentioned that developing systems thinking begins with studying systems concepts^[Including understanding their interconnections.]. Now, you are paying more conscious attention to modeling techniques, and soon you will move on to meta-modeling. Meta-modeling is the process of creating table templates—that is, defining the names of the rows and/or columns of a table (the properties of the table). This is exactly what the course developers did to create universal tables, and when you become Chief Transformation Officers, you will create similar tables for your employees for your own work projects^[Some tables you will take from the course, but you can also create your own unique tables with concepts from your applied field.]. For now, you are engaged in modeling yourself, that is, filling out the course tables^[Attractive diagrams made of boxes and arrows are a popular understanding of systems modeling. However, tables and even texts are more appropriate and systems-oriented for complex projects and systems.]. But to do this, you need to know the subject area, since the tables reflect specific work activities and use concepts from applied methods.

Thus, to develop systems thinking, it is necessary to study the systems language, practice modeling, and meta-modeling. We recommend doing this through thinking through writing and working with tables, rather than diagrams: fill out and create tables for your own work projects. Therefore, use your work time for modeling and meta-modeling, because you cannot learn to drive a car only on a training lot—that’s why students are sent out onto city roads almost immediately. So, use the modeling tool (Coda or at least our course as a simulator) right away in your actual work environment.
