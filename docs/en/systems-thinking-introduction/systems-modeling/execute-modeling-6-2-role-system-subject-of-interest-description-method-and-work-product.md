# Complete the modeling exercise: 6.2. Role, System, Subject of Interest, Description Method, and Work Artifact

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. You may not always know the exact name of the description method, so formulate its main characteristic (action). If necessary, use ChatGPT and Google for this. During the course, it will be beneficial to broaden your vocational (activity) horizons, specifically by learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts across various fields. Note that while you may have a good understanding of activities in medicine, you might not be as familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from both professional and personal projects. Create notes for further exploration if needed. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section.

Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.
