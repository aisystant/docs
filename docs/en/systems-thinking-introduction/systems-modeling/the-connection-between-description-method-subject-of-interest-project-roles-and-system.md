title: The Connection Between Description Method, Subject of Interest, Project Roles,
  and System
---

In previous sections, it was mentioned that the subject of interest is connected to the system. A system can be characterized by different subjects of interest. These subjects of interest are linked to project roles, meaning that individuals in these roles are concerned with specific characteristics of the system.

The team determines which project roles' interests will be addressed during the creation of the system. It's important to note that not all interests can be addressed due to limited resources (time and funds), but at the same time, the team must avoid fatal errors. A fatal error would be neglecting a particular interest, which could later result in significant and irreparable costs. This affects what work artifacts (documentation) will be necessary. Work artifacts are physical carriers that contain the system description pertaining to a specific subject of interest.

To create the documentation, one must be proficient in a certain practice or method of description. Through this method of description, a physical medium is used to create a system description that corresponds to the subject of interest in the system.

For example, a racer's interest lies in the speed of the race car. Put differently, the external project role of "racer" has a subject of interest, "speed," in the system "race car." The developers decided to meet the racer's interests, meaning the team considered satisfying the interests of this project role. This implies that they will continue working with this subject of interest and produce documentation (a computer model) related to it.

Next, the developers choose a description method to create the system description. They select one of the methods that allow them to build a computer model for calculating the car's speed. This computer model is a work artifact containing the system description regarding the subject of interest, "speed."

In fact, this model can consider not only this subject of interest but others as well. The total number of work artifacts (documentation) describing the system is proportional to the number of subjects of interest, and the number of subjects of interest is proportional to the number of project roles the team has decided to satisfy. While all project roles are considered, the team may choose to satisfy only selected ones. For each project role being addressed, a work artifact is created. The diagram shows only the external project role, but the same applies to internal project roles as well.
