# Examples of Describing a System as a Transparent Box

Let's examine three descriptions using the example of a clock^[Image by A. Turkhanov.].

Functional description is the depiction of subsystems as roles or functional objects. A functional description illustrates "how the system operates internally." For instance, a functional diagram shows how a clock works. Note that this diagram lacks modules because the focus here is on the functional parts of the clock. These parts display their functional or role behavior.

Constructive or physical modules are the objects assembled into the clock system. A modular description or breakdown into parts shows what the system is made of. As you can see, the modular diagram indicates many constructive parts of the system. It doesn't clarify the working principle of the clock, but it clearly shows how to assemble a clock from gears, springs, hands, and other modules.

The third description is about the spatial locations where the parts of the system are placed. Here, it is important to know where in the universe the system's parts are located. This is spatial breakdown. Without knowing the exact positioning of the modules, the system will not function.

System levels are determined by functional breakdown, which is central in systems thinking! Therefore, functional breakdown is often called system breakdown. What about the others? Those are regular breakdowns. And, of course, it should not be forgotten that there are modular and spatial breakdowns.

As you can see, all systems at each system level interact with each other as functional objects. This interaction is described by a functional diagram. At the same system level, you can identify specific physical objects that perform these functions (or play the role of functional objects). These physical objects are located somewhere in space. If we move to another system level, everything will be exactly the same there.

For example, we can identify functional, physical objects and their locations at the subsystem level of the engine. Then we can identify functional, physical objects and their locations at the level of the entire car. At this level, we will no longer consider the structure of the engine, as it will be part of the car system. Moreover, the engine system can be viewed from a functional point of view—this functional object should deliver torque^[In culture, the functional object of the engine system is usually called an engine. It's a role, with the function of moving. Internal combustion engines move by transmitting torque to the chassis.]. The engine system can also be seen as a physical object—this would be the BD-1324 gasoline engine. We can rise one level higher, and there will be other functional, physical objects and their locations.

The next example involves the system of a person as a constructor, who can create successful systems in diverse projects. The constructor exhibits functional behavior—life mastery. Life mastery consists of the following functional parts:

* thinking mastery or intellect;
* applied mastery.

Another example concerns the functional parts of the car system. These would include the chassis, body, and engine. Here, it's possible to conduct further system breakdown and analyze the structure of the chassis. Consequently, this also delineates the next system level.
