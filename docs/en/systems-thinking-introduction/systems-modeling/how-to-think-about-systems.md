# How to Think About Systems?

The goal of this section is to explore how to think about systems and understand how system modeling occurs.

Thinking about systems means modeling them â€” essentially describing and documenting them. System modeling is a process of creating system descriptions that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within the system, as well as its interaction with the external environment.

Before creating a system, you need to generate a description of it, or more accurately, a work artifact containing this description, which is the system documentation. Implementing the system is far more expensive than creating documentation with a description, which is why, in the modern world, emphasis is placed on modeling the system as both "black" and "transparent" boxes.

Modeling in systems thinking is the primary tool for combating complexity. The complexity also arises from the fact that you deal with multiple systems in a project and within an enterprise, each of which needs to be described as both "black" and "transparent" boxes. Therefore, you will have to create multiple descriptions for a wide range of systems and areas of interest [^1]. It's not only about describing the system of interest but also about describing the areas of interest of the supersystem and the creation system, and often it's necessary to describe both our system and the systems within the creation chains.

All of this would be challenging if it weren't for the universality of the approach to these descriptions. In this section, we will understand concepts that will allow you to create system descriptions while working with a team of systems specialists. To achieve this:

1. We will study approaches for describing any system as both "black" and "transparent" boxes;
2. We will delve into specific types of descriptions across different areas of interest in project activities.

[ ^1 ]: In our course and in the second semester of the main program, you primarily deal with the universal approach to modeling any system, and in the third semester, you work on describing all the systems involved in the project.
