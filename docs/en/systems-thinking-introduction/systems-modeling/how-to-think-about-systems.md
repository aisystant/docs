title: How to Think About Systems?

# Objectives of the Section

The objective of this section is to understand how to think about systems and comprehend how systems modeling occurs.

Thinking about systems means modeling them—that is, describing and documenting them. Systems modeling is the process of creating system descriptions that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within a system, as well as its interaction with the external **systems environment**.

Before creating a system, it is necessary to create its description—in other words, a work artifact containing this description, known as system documentation. Implementing a system is much costlier than creating documentation with the description, which is why in the modern world, significant attention is given to modeling the system as both a “black box” and a “transparent box.”

In systems thinking, modeling is the primary means of tackling complexity. The complexity also lies in the fact that in a project or enterprise, you deal with multiple systems, each requiring a description as both a "black box" and a "transparent box." Therefore, you will need to create multiple descriptions for various systems and **subjects of interest**. Descriptions are not only made for the system of interest but also for areas of interest in the **supersystem** and the **system-creator**, and it is often necessary to describe our system and the systems within the creation chains.

This would be challenging were it not for the universality of the approach to such descriptions. In this section, we will delve into concepts that will allow you to compile system descriptions while working within a team of systems specialists. To achieve this:

1. We will study approaches to describing any system as both a “black box” and a “transparent box.”
2. We will explore specific types of descriptions in various **subjects of interest** in project activities.
