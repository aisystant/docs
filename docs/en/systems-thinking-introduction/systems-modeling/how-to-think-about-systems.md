# How to Think About Systems?

The goal of this section is to delve into how to think about systems and understand how systems modeling takes place.

Thinking about systems means modeling them—i.e., describing and documenting them. Systems modeling is the process of creating system descriptions that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within a system, as well as its interactions with the external environment.

Before creating a system, it is necessary to produce its description, more specifically, the work artifact containing this description—i.e., the documentation. Implementing a system is much more expensive than creating the documentation with its description, which is why in today's world, much attention is paid to modeling the system as both a "black box" and a "transparent box."

Modeling in systems thinking is the primary tool in combating complexity. The challenge with complexity is that in a project and within an enterprise, you are dealing with multiple systems, each of which needs to be described as both a "black box" and a "transparent box." Thus, you will need to create numerous descriptions for a wide variety of systems and subjects of interest. [ ^1 ] ^[In our course and during the second semester of the main program, you primarily deal with a universal approach to modeling any system, whereas in the third semester, you focus on describing all systems involved in the project.] Not only is the system of interest described, but so are the interests pertaining to the supersystem and the creation systems. Often, it is also necessary to describe our system and the systems within the creation chains.

This would be difficult to achieve if not for the universality of the approach to such descriptions. In this section, we will explore the concepts that allow you to develop system descriptions while being part of a team of systems specialists. To accomplish this:

1. We will study approaches for describing any system as both a "black box" and a "transparent box."
2. We will explore specific types of descriptions for different subjects of interest in project activities.
