# Descriptions and Documentation of Various Areas of Interest

At the end of the subsection "How to Think About Systems?" we focused on approaches to describing any system as either a "black box" or a "transparent box" [^1]. We have already covered this in previous parts. In this subsection, we will delve into specific types of descriptions across different areas of interest in project activities.

The fact is, in project activities (or in an enterprise), you are surrounded by a myriad of documents describing various systems [^2]. At an enterprise, multiple projects are often underway simultaneously, and you may be involved in several of them. In your daily work activities, you may not always be tasked with describing the system of interest. For instance, you might describe the client base, create certain subsystems of a production line for the system of interest, or simply fill out financial templates.

Refer once more to Table 3x3 and pay attention to the enumeration of work artifacts in each cell. Examine each cell and try to identify your cell(s) and the work artifacts you work with and create.

For example, note that the system of interest as a "black box" in terms of its role behavior (cell 1.2 in Table 3x3) is described as a "usage concept." Though your specific enterprise may not use this exact term—"usage concept" might be known by another name [^3]. The exact name of the work artifact in each cell of Table 3x3 also depends on the subject area and chosen method of description. If you are creating a car, you will have one set of methods for all cells, whereas an IT system will have different ones.

Systems thinking will help you better communicate with specialists, but you also need to consciously [^4] understand your subject area, including reaching out to the physical world. That is, you need to know from which cell of Table 3x3 you are viewing other project roles [^5] and with which work artifacts you communicate with them.

If you do not know your subject area and cannot reach into changes in the physical world (that is, to specific work artifacts), this is a direct path to failure. You will describe strange things, implement random changes in the physical world, or not even touch the physical world with your ideas.

In our course, we merely highlight that there are different areas of interest and that documentation within each is created using specific methods of description. Each enterprise has employees who specialize in specific subject areas and create this documentation using these description methods.

For example, a marketer (in cell 1.1 of Table 3x3) creates a description of the target audience. From our course, you already understand what this documentation entails, what role it serves, and for whom this work artifact is created. You should also already know that the client base is a system in the real/physical world, and a computer CRM system is to the client base what a photograph of a person is to an individual—a document with a description and convenient means of viewing.

However, you are unlikely to be able to create this "client base" system or even the documentation describing it if you are not the appropriate specialist. The same applies to all other cells of Table 3x3. Our course provided you with a high-level overview of all areas of interest and taught you a universal approach to modeling any system. But the specific modeling and creation of systems are done by applied specialists. The good news is that you now know how to interact with them. That is, you understand their subjects of interest, methods, work artifacts, etc.

[^1]: These approaches are applied to both the system of interest and the supersystem, to our system or the creation system. 
[^2]: At different system levels or creation chains.
[^3]: Documentation for the usage concept may be differently named at specific enterprises: standard documents, use cases, technical specifications, files with use case diagrams in certain languages, database fragments with information models.
[^4]: Awareness arises when you focus attention on your roles, best sota-methods, subjects of interest and preferences, work artifacts, etc.
[^5]: To all other team members or external project roles.
