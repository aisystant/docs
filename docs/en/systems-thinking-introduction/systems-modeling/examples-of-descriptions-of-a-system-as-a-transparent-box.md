# Examples of System Descriptions as a Transparent Box

Let's consider three descriptions using the example of a clock [ ^1 ].

Functional description is a depiction of subsystems as role-based or functional objects. It shows "how the system works internally." For example, the functional diagram illustrates how a clock operates. Note that this diagram does not include modules, as it emphasizes the clock's functional parts. These parts demonstrate their functional or role behavior.

Constructive or physical modules are the objects assembled into the clock system. A modular description or breakdown reveals what the system is made up of. As you can see, the modular diagram indicates many constructive parts of the system. While it doesn't explain how the clock works, it clearly shows how to assemble the clock from gears, springs, hands, and other modules.

The third description involves the spatial arrangement of the system's parts. It is crucial to know the location of the system's parts throughout the universe. This spatial breakdown is essential because if the modules' precise location is unknown, the system will not function.

System levels are determined by functional breakdown—the primary focus in systems thinking! Hence, functional breakdowns are often called system breakdowns. As for the others, they are considered ordinary breakdowns. Of course, we shouldn't forget about modular and spatial breakdowns.

As you can see, all systems interact as functional objects at each system level. This interaction is depicted by the functional diagram. At the same system level, you can identify specific physical objects that perform these functions (or act as functional objects). These physical objects are located somewhere in space. If we move to another system level, everything will follow a similar pattern.

For instance, we can identify functional, physical objects and their placement at the subsystem level of an engine. Then, we can identify functional, physical objects and their location at the entire vehicle’s level. At this point, we won't analyze the engine structure further; it will be part of the vehicle system. Notably, the motor system can be viewed from a functional perspective, where this functional object must deliver torque [ ^2 ]. Also, the motor system can be viewed as a physical object—namely, a BD-1324 gasoline engine. Moving up one more level will reveal other functional, physical objects and their placements.

The next example involves the system of a human constructor capable of creating successful systems in various projects. The constructor has functional behavior known as life mastery. Life mastery consists of the following functional components:

* thinking mastery or intellect;
* applied mastery.

Another example pertains to the functional parts of a vehicle system, such as the chassis, body, and engine. Each, in turn, can undergo further system breakdown, allowing an exploration of the chassis design. Consequently, the next system level can be identified.
