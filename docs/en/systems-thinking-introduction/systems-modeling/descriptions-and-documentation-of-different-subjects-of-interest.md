### Approaches to System Descriptions

At the end of the subsection "How to Think About Systems?", we explored approaches to describing any system as a "black" and "transparent" box.[^1] We covered this in previous sections. In this subsection, we will delve into specific types of descriptions across different areas of interest in project activities.

In project activities (or within a company), you are surrounded by a multitude of documents describing various systems.[^2] Simultaneously, multiple projects are underway within a company, and you might be involved in several of them. As part of your daily work activities, you may not always describe the system of interest. For example, you might personally describe the client base, create certain subsystems of the production conveyor for the system of interest, or just fill out financial templates.

Refer once more to Table 3x3 and pay attention to the enumeration of work artifacts in each cell. Examine each cell and try to find your cell(s) and the work artifacts you interact with and create.

For instance, note that the system of interest as a "black box" concerning its role behavior (cell 1.2 of Table 3x3) is described as a "usage concept." Even though your particular company might not use this exact term, meaning that "usage concept" might be named differently.[^3] The specific name of the work artifact in each cell of Table 3x3 also depends on the subject area and the chosen method of description. If you are creating a vehicle, you will have certain methods of description across all cells, whereas if it's an IT system, you will have others.

**Using a systems approach** will help you better communicate with specialists; however, you also need to consciously[^4] understand your subject area, including reaching into the physical world. This means knowing from which cell in Table 3x3 you're viewing other project roles[^5] and through which work artifacts you communicate with them.

Not knowing your subject area and failing to connect your thoughts to changes in the physical world (i.e., specific work artifacts) is a direct path to failure. You might describe odd things, implement random changes in the physical world, or not address it at all with your ideas.

At Aisystant, we merely highlight that there are different areas of interest, and that documentation is created in each using specific methods of description. Every company has employees specializing in particular subject areas who create this documentation using descriptive methods.

For example, a marketer (in cell 1.1 of Table 3x3) creates a description of the target audience. You already understand from our course what this documentation entails, what role it plays, and for whom this work artifact is created. You should also realize that the client base is a system in the real/physical world, while a computerized CRM system is to the client base what a photograph is to a personâ€”a document with a description and convenient viewing tools.

However, you're unlikely to be able to create this "client base" system or even the documentation describing it without being an appropriate specialist. The same applies to all other cells of Table 3x3. In our course, you gained a high-level overview of all areas of interest and learned a universal approach to modeling any system. However, actual modeling and system creation are carried out by applied specialists. The good news is that you now know how to interact with them. You understand their subjects of interest, methods, work artifacts, etc.

[^1]: These approaches apply to both the system of interest and the supersystem, to our system or to the creation system.
[^2]: Across different system levels or creation chains.
[^3]: Documentation for the usage concept may be referred to differently across different companies: standard documents, use cases, technical specifications, diagram files in certain languages, or database fragments with an information model.
[^4]: Awareness arises when you focus attention on your roles, best sota-methods, subjects of interest, preferences, work artifacts, etc.
[^5]: To all other team members or to external project roles.
