# Descriptions and Documentation for Various Areas of Interest

At the end of the subsection "How to Think About Systems?" we explored approaches to describing any system as either a "black" or "transparent" box [ ^1 ], which we've discussed in previous sections. In this subsection, we will delve into specific types of descriptions for various areas of interest in project activities.

The fact is that in project activities (or within an enterprise), you are surrounded by a multitude of documents describing various systems [ ^2 ]. Numerous projects are underway simultaneously within an enterprise, and you may be involved in several of them. In your daily work activities, you may not necessarily or always describe the system of interest. For example, you might personally describe the client base, create some subsystems of the production line for the system of interest, or simply fill out financial templates.

Refer again to the 3x3 Table and pay attention to the list of work artifacts in each cell. Examine each cell and try to identify your specific cell(s) and the work artifacts you work with and create.

For instance, note that the system of interest as a "black box" in terms of its role-based behavior (cell 1.2 of the 3x3 Table) is described in the form of a "usage concept." Although in your specific enterprise, it might not have this exact name—"usage concept" might be called something else [ ^3 ]. The precise name of the work artifact in each cell of the 3x3 Table also depends on the subject area and the chosen description method. If you are creating an automotive system, you will have one set of description methods for all cells, whereas for an IT system, you would have others.

Systems thinking will help you better communicate with specialists, but it is also essential for you to consciously [ ^4 ] understand your subject area, including reaching into the physical world. This means knowing from which cell of the 3x3 Table you view other project roles [ ^5 ] and through which work artifacts you communicate with them.

If you do not know your subject area and cannot think through to changes in the physical world (i.e., specific work artifacts), it's a direct path to failure. You may end up describing peculiar things, implementing random changes in the physical world, or not impacting the physical world with your ideas at all.

In our course, we simply highlight that there are different areas of interest, and in each, documentation is created using specific description methods. Every enterprise has employees specializing in certain subject areas who create this documentation using description methods.

For example, a marketer (in cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table) creates a description of the target audience. From our course, you understand what this documentation is, the role it serves, and for whom this work artifact is created. You should also already grasp that the client base is a system in the real/physical world, and a computer CRM system is related to this client base, similar to how a photograph of a person relates to the person—a document with a description and convenient means of document viewing.

However, you are unlikely to be able to create this "client base" system or even documentation describing it if you are not the relevant specialist. This applies to all other cells of the 3x3 Table. In our course, you have gained a high-level understanding of all areas of interest and learned a universal approach to modeling any system. But the specific modeling and system creation are carried out by applied specialists. The good news is that now you know how to interact with them, meaning you understand their subjects of interest, methods, work artifacts, etc.

[ ^1 ]: These approaches are applied to the system of interest, the supersystem, our system, or the creation system.  
[ ^2 ]: At different system levels or creation chains.  
[ ^3 ]: Usage concept documentation may be named differently at a specific enterprise: standard documents, use cases, technical specifications, files with usage scenario diagrams in certain languages, database fragments with an information model.  
[ ^4 ]: Consciousness arises when you focus on your roles, optimal sota-methods, subjects of interest and preferences, work artifacts, etc.  
[ ^5 ]: To all other team members or external project roles.
