# System Descriptions and the Systems Language

In the textbook "Systems Thinking", a diagram illustrates most systems thinking concepts we've already discussed. Fluency in systems thinking, which will enable you to apply it to work projects, means you can easily see the connections between these concepts. On this diagram, seven main concepts (alphas [ ^1 ]) are highlighted in color, while other concepts and sub-alphas are not highlighted. However, it is evident that all concepts are interconnected. Most of these connections focus on the system's embodiment. This is our successful system, the purpose for studying systems thinking with all these systems concepts.

You might feel that such an approach is somewhat excessive. But imagine an analogy where you create a common conceptual network based on a car. Adults have fluency in the concept of a "car" not in terms of a systems approach, but simply as part of their domain knowledge. You would likely quickly identify concepts such as fuel, movement, weather, passenger, environment, luxury, winter tires, and many others that help explain activities related to cars.

You would easily sketch a diagram where all these concepts are interrelated [ ^2 ]. For a 17th-century resident, many terms related to cars would be utterly incomprehensible. But you handle these concepts with ease because you live among them. In the same way, it is recommended to "immerse" yourself in systems thinking concepts to create successful systems in both your personal and work projects. Fluent handling of systems concepts means you quickly identify them in your project, for example, the system of interest or a description method for the subject of interest, such as "price" or "safety" [ ^3 ].

The use of systems concepts is necessary for composing (modeling) system descriptions required to create successful systems. It is essential to make descriptions for all areas of interest in the supersystem, the system of interest, and the creator.

In this section, we will focus on the following:

* how to describe any systems using systems language, including role descriptions, models, the method of description, etc.;
* learn about the four main descriptions of a system as a transparent box, which answer the subjects of interest in the internal workings of any system;
* the types of system documentation for areas of interest pertaining to the three kinds of systems.

[ ^1 ]: The OMG Essence standard (http://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/) offers a special kind of functional objects for monitoring project status changes—known as ALPHA (Abstract-Level Progress Health Attribute). An alpha is an object of focus whose functional/role characteristics correspond to the area of interest "how the project works" (not the system of interest, but the project, meaning creation systems). If we want to think coherently about how a project works, how the system of interest is created, and then developed by its creators in the course of their work, we need to focus not on arbitrary objects but on alphas within the project.

[ ^2 ]: Fuel is poured into a car’s gas tank. In this simple sentence, I described the physical world using the concepts "fuel" and "gas tank" and connected them with another concept-action "poured." The fact is that you are well-acquainted with these concepts, and your brain easily links them while quickly modeling the physical world. If suddenly fuel starts leaking outside the gas tank, you will take specific actions. These actions, too, can be described with a particular model.

[ ^3 ]: Similarly, in everyday life, you effortlessly handle the concepts of "mom" and "dad," and, for instance, when you visit your friend, you quickly figure out who is who.
