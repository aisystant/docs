## Describing a System as a "Black Box"

To describe a system as a "black box," consider the following example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to review the theoretical material to understand the distinctions between termsâ€”system characteristic, system state, indicator of system characteristic, and system interface. After reviewing the example in the first row, fill in the empty cells with 1-3 examples. If you lack the breadth of knowledge to select appropriate words and designations (names), feel free to use resources like ChatGPT or Google.

**Example:**

| **System Name**         | **System Characteristic** | **System State**         | **Indicator of Characteristic** | **System Interface**       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Personal Computer       | Processing Speed          | Active                   | CPU Clock Rate                  | Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor   |
| Air Conditioning System | Temperature Regulation    | Cooling                  | Thermostat Setting              | Remote Control             |
| Smart Lighting System   | Energy Efficiency         | On                       | Energy Consumption Level        | Smartphone App             |
