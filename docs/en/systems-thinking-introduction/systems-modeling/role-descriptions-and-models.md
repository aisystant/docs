# Role Descriptions and Models

In the first section of the course, we discussed that a system has certain classic properties and is dependent on design roles. We then learned that numerous subjects of interest pertain to the system, and each description is created for a particular subject of interest.

In an adapted diagram from ISO 42010[^1], you can see how to think about the interests regarding the system, design roles, role description, models, and so on. This international standard provides guidelines on how to think about system descriptions.

The standard itself only addresses architectural descriptions, but its provisions can readily be applied to any descriptions of various systems. For example, one can apply this scheme not to a system of interest, but to a creation system.

In real life, everything usually starts with identifying the type of role-based description that stems from a specific interest. For example, an enterprise has a subject of interest—taxes. There are certain design roles (each with its methods and work artifacts) associated with this subject. However, the tax inspector, manager, and accountant may have differing preferences in this subject of interest.

To address this subject of interest, a tax description is formed, which must include the preferences of all design roles. Each design role has its desires, but to reach an agreement, a common description for all interested[^2] design roles must be created.

This common description consists of certain models. It is easy to discuss tax matters because many metamodels are established by the state in the form of regulatory documents. These include documents like the "Balance Sheet," "Profit and Loss Statement," and others. When these metamodels are filled with corresponding report data, they become models—descriptions of a specific enterprise and its business activities.

As you have guessed, there is a specific method of description used to create this tax description. It is the method of accounting and tax reporting.

The state is concerned about taxes and thus promotes its subject of interest through the regulatory endorsement of descriptive methods (metamodels) and meticulously reviews the models presented by accountants. Learn from the tax authorities how to pay attention to modeling.

On the other hand, you should never forget that ultimately you need the implementation of a system, and the description given to us in the form of models, drawings, manufacturing instructions, and so forth, is necessary only because without it, it is very difficult to implement a functioning system.
