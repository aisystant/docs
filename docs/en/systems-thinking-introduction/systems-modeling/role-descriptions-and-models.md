# Introduction to System Descriptions and Interests

In the first section of the course, it was discussed that a system possesses certain classic properties and depends on project roles. We later discovered that there are numerous **subjects of interest** related to the system, and each description is created for a specific subject of interest.

Through the adapted diagram from ISO 42010^[For more details on this standard, refer to the textbook "Systems Thinking."], you can see how to reason about interests in the system, project roles, role descriptions, models, and so forth. This international standard provides guidance on how to consider a system description.

The standard itself discusses only architectural descriptions, but its principles can certainly be applied to any descriptions of different systems. For example, you could apply this framework not to the **system of interest**, but to the **creation system**.

In practice, the process usually begins with identifying the type of role description, which stems from a specific interest. For instance, an enterprise may have a subject of interest—taxes. There are specific project roles (with their methods and work artifacts) that possess this subject of interest. However, the preferences of the tax officer, manager, and accountant in this subject of interest might not align.

To address this subject of interest, a tax description is formed, which must include all preferences of the project roles. Each project role desires its own focus, but to reach an agreement, it is necessary to create a common description for all involved project roles with the same subject of interest.

This description consists of specific models. Discussing tax issues becomes simpler because many metamodels are established by the government in corresponding regulatory documents. These include documents like the "Balance Sheet," "Profit and Loss Statement," and others. When these metamodels are filled with corresponding report data, they become models—descriptions of a specific enterprise and its operational activities.

As you may have guessed, there is a specific method of description used to compile this tax description. This method involves accounting and tax accounting practices.

The government is keen on taxes, hence it advances its subject of interest through normative affirmation of the description methods (metamodels) and meticulously reviews the models presented by accountants. Take a cue from the tax officials on how to focus on modeling.

Nevertheless, on the other hand, you must not forget even for a moment that eventually, you need the realization of the system. The description, provided in the form of models, drawings, manufacturing instructions, etc., is essential only because without it, it would be incredibly challenging to bring a functional system to life.
