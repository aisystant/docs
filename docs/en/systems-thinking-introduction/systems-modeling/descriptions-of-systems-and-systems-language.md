# System Descriptions and Systems Language

In a diagram from the textbook "Systems Thinking," most of the systems thinking concepts we've discussed are illustrated. Proficiency in systems thinking, which enables its application to work projects, means you can easily see the connections between these concepts. This diagram highlights seven key concepts (alphas [ ^1 ] in color, while the other concepts and sub-alphas are not, showing that all concepts are interconnected. Most connections lead to the system's embodiment, which is our successful system, and the reason we study systems thinking with all these system concepts.

You might think that such an approach is excessive in many ways. However, imagine an analogy and create a commonplace conceptual network with a car at its core. Adults have fluid thinking about the term "car," not from a systems thinking perspective, but simply as a domain area. You'd likely quickly identify concepts like fuel, movement, weather, passenger, environment, luxury, winter tires, and many more that help explain car-related activities.

Comfortably, you'll sketch a diagram where all these concepts are interlinked [ ^2 ]. For a person from the 17th century, many car-related terms would be entirely incomprehensible. Yet, you handle these concepts with ease because you live among them. Similarly, it's recommended to "immerse" yourself in systems thinking concepts to create successful systems in both personal life and work projects. Fluent operation of systems concepts means you quickly locate them in your project, for example, the system of interest or a description method for a subject of interest like "price" or "safety" [ ^3 ].

The use of systems concepts is necessary to compose (model) system descriptions required for creating successful systems. It is essential to provide descriptions across all areas of interest for the supersystem, system of interest, and creator.

In this section, we will focus on the following:

* How to describe any systems using systems language, including role descriptions, models, description methods, and more;
* Learn about the four main descriptions of a system as a transparent box, which address the subjects of interest regarding any system's internal structure;
* What documentation exists for the areas of interest for the three types of systems.

[ ^1 ]: The OMG Essence Standard (http://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/) offers a particular type of functional object for monitoring a project's status changeâ€”alpha (ALPHA or Abstract-Level Progress Health Attribute). An alpha is an object of focus, whose functional/role character pertains to the interest area "how the project works" (not the system of interest, but the project, i.e., creation systems). If we wish to think coherently about how a project works, how the system of interest is created, and then developed by the creators during their work, we need to focus our attention in the project on alphas, not arbitrary objects.

[ ^2 ]: Fuel is poured into a car's gas tank. In this simple sentence, I describe the physical world using the concepts of "fuel" and "gas tank," linking them with another concept-action "poured." You are familiar with these concepts, allowing your brain to connect them easily and quickly model the physical world. If fuel suddenly leaks outside the tank, you'd take certain actions, describable by a specific model.

[ ^3 ]: Similarly, in everyday life, you handle the concepts of "mom" and "dad" fluently. For example, when visiting a friend's home, you quickly discern who's who.
