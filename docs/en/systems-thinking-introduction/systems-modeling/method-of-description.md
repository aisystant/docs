# Method of Description

You already know that a system description consists of role descriptions, which in turn consist of models. To create a role description, a description method (practice) is required. The description method is presented as a theory explaining how to create system descriptions and the necessary tools to obtain a work artifact (system documentation). This theory sets out metamodels that are filled with data, which then become models. Models can be on various media, such as paper or computers. When this occurs, we refer to it as documentation.

It's easiest to consider that the description method, from a substantive point of view, is a set of conventions for multi-layered map-models describing a territory. The territory is the system, the map is the documentation with the system description, and there is a method for compiling the map^[For example, a photogrammetric method for creating topographic maps.], which includes metamodels, concepts, principles, etc. The theory of composing this description, along with the technology of map creation, is a description method.

The universality of the top-level modeling approach means that descriptions are made in response to a specific subject of interest (or preference) to a particular system. For this, a role (or roles) uses a specific description method to produce documentation addressed to another role. For instance, a topographic map is created in response to the interest in the "relief" of the "territory" system (a certain area). The map is created by topographers and used by surveyors, geologists, geographers, or perhaps designers creating a house project.

The description method allows for the creation of descriptions of any systems. Of course, attention should primarily be paid to the system of interest, but in project activities or at an enterprise, you encounter numerous documents describing various systems (supersystems, subsystems, creation systems, etc.).

In the above table, you see the connection between the concepts of role, interest, role description, and description method. Note that you may often have seen similar role descriptions in the form of documents. Many of you possess various description methods through which you create specific documents. Make sure to describe your roles, description methods, and work artifacts in the relevant modeling exercise from the course.

The subject of interest for different roles can be the same while the role descriptions differ. One role may have several interests. In such cases, one description can be created that addresses multiple subjects of interest.

Choosing the correct description methods is essential. For example, different methods are needed for tax, financial, and managerial descriptions. For tax purposes, you need tax and accounting methods; for financial descriptions, IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP; and for financial-management descriptions, there are managerial accounting methods. Note that all three descriptions (methods and work artifacts) are created for three different roles: the tax consultant, the shareholder, and the manager.

You already understand well that high-quality role descriptions cannot be made if the role description method and corresponding documentation are not explicitly considered. They cannot be done unconsciously. Being aware of the application of the description method increases the likelihood that you will timely notice the need to master a new method.
