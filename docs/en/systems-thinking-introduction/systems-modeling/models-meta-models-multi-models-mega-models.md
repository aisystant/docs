# Models, Meta-models, Multi-models, Mega-models

You already know that the result of modeling is models, which can exist on various physical media. A model helps to make judgments about the object being modeled. The object being modeled is the system of interest, as well as other types of systems. Models exist for the supersystem, creation systems, surrounding systems, or subsystems.

Let us emphasize once again that models are created by a specific method of description. It is this method that indicates what is most important in the object being modeled and what needs to be considered in the models. This "most important" aspect for a particular model is called a meta-model.

For example, there is a system—the city of Moscow. And there is a map of the city. The map is a model of the city of Moscow, and the legend of the map is the meta-model. The map contains a negligible part of the city's information, but it's the most important information that someone decided to reflect. One map might show city districts, another roads and industrial enterprises, and yet another water protection zones, etc.

The legend of each such map indicates what is significant in the territories and what needs to be displayed in these specific models. You will see the road on the map—that's important—but not its width, as it wasn't deemed important by the map's creator.

A collection of interconnected models made using different methods of description is usually called a multi-model. It's like a collection of various maps for the same territory: flora, fauna, population density, relief, road networks, etc.

Besides the set of maps, we also need to have a set of legends for these maps. A multi-model combined with its defining meta-models is called a mega-model.

For more details on models, meta-models, multi-models, and mega-models, refer to the textbook “Systems Thinking.” This is helpful for broadening one's horizons. Subsequently, it's necessary to apply these concepts in project activities.

Errors in a system model should ideally be identified (and corrected) during the description and documentation of the system, meaning before its production and certainly not during its operation. As the saying goes: measure seven times, produce once!
