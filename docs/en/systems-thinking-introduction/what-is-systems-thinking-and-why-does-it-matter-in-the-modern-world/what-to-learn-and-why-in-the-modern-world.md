# What to Learn and Why in the Modern World

Anyone spends their whole life learning, but not everyone is aware of it. Not everyone understands what they gain from learning, what they personally need to learn, or what it means to take on the role of a student^[The answer to the question “How to learn?” is given in the course “Practices of Self-Development.”]. Nevertheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills help a person acquire knowledge of the world: dealing with uncertainty, solving problems, and achieving goals^[Including finding the meaning of life. See the post “What is most important in life” in the Aisystant club: <https://systemsworld.club/t/chto-v-zhizni-glavnoe/5034>.]. And the meaning of knowledge acquisition is one of the general answers to the question, “Why learn?”

David Deutsch’s Principle of Optimism^[Post “About Optimism”: <https://systemsworld.club/t/topic/3566>.] states that problems will always exist, and it is only a lack of knowledge that prevents a person from dealing with them at any given moment. After all, if we know how to solve certain problems, then for us, they are not problems at all. We simply need to apply the knowledge we have—that is, to take action.

The knowledge^[That is, knowledge that is up-to-date, not outdated or unscientific.] we acquire comes primarily from theories (disciplines)^[Of course, practice is essential: “theory without practice is dead, practice without theory is blind.”], and when we apply this knowledge in life (using certain tools to do so), we demonstrate mastery. Thanks to mastery, something changes (or appears) in the physical world.

For example, a person studies the discipline of “Accounting,” and then, using a tool^[From here on, we will mainly use the word “tool,” with “technology” remaining as a synonym.] such as 1C or SAP, demonstrates the mastery of an accountant: creating a work artifact^[A work artifact is a physical (tangible) result of your work. It can take various forms, including writing texts, creating diagrams, developing databases, or making physical objects (like a chair). Work artifacts help you study and apply practice alongside theory, as well as track your progress and results. In a specific course or practice, the list of work artifacts and their use is usually described in the relevant material or assignment.]—an accounting balance sheet. In the same way, one can study “Carpentry” and then, using carpentry tools, create a work artifact—a chair. The key point is that some physical objects have appeared in the world, and their appearance changes the world.

The first answer to the question “What should you learn?” is this: you need to learn the best theories and also master the tools of these disciplines in order to produce the best work artifacts. It’s great if you can discover your calling—that is, uncover what nature has gifted you with. To do this, you need to test your hypotheses, which means studying the relevant theory. For example, if you have a talent for music, you can’t do without music theory^[Of course, you can become a professional through practice, practice, and more practice, but without theory, the path is much longer (and your chances of success are much lower). It’s best to reinforce your talent with the best theories known to humanity—in other words, to become cultured.], and if you get along well with people, systems management will help you become a leader. Without good theory, it’s impossible to progress quickly and consistently, or to achieve high and stable results.

To study any theory, it’s important to understand that at the meta-level, it can be broken down into: concepts (notions, terms), principles (theorems, laws, models), roles, work artifacts, procedures (checklists) for creating work artifacts, and explanations (proofs, clarifications, justifications). For example, in the discipline of “Accounting,” we can identify: concepts—asset, liability, accountant, etc.; roles—accountant, tax specialist; principle—double-entry bookkeeping; work artifacts—balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and so on.

The next answer to the question “What should you learn?” is to divide knowledge (theory, discipline) into the following two categories, which develop:

1. thinking mastery—it helps you deal with new and previously unknown problems;
2. applied mastery—it solves a specific class of problems^[For example, this is the professional mastery of a driver, swimmer, marketer, architect, or manager.].

For a modern person, it is important to constantly develop thinking mastery (intellect) and, when necessary, to develop specific applied mastery (professional skills and abilities)^[How to increase your value in the job market is discussed in the club post: <https://systemsworld.club/t/kak-povyshat-svoyu-czennost-na-rynke-truda-ili-pro-karla-rante-i-moniku-prodakt-menedzhera/4473>.]. That is, every person is both an intellectual and a professional in the sense that they constantly have to deal with new problems using their intellect and solve a certain known class of problems as a professional^[A professional works almost on autopilot, meaning they have unconscious competence. For example, you clean your apartment or drive a car automatically. But when you were first learning a new skill, you mainly relied on your intellect. Over time, your intellect is engaged less and less, and more actions are performed automatically. This is related to minimizing energy and attention, which are limited resources.] in a particular field.

Even when a child is learning to walk, they use their intellect, and once they master the skill, they develop applied mastery^[That is, intellect also helps you master new applied skills more quickly. When a new problem arises, intellect is engaged to find a solution based on existing experience and current applied mastery. Or, intellect determines that a new skill is needed and helps you master it more quickly.]. The development of even the simplest applied mastery involves intellect, which is initially based on innate reflexes and genes. It continues to develop as a person encounters new things. For example, a child goes to the store for the first time, moves to another city to study after school, or tackles new work problems. Usually, people develop their intellect unconsciously.

We could really use formal thinking techniques and approaches when we create a car or an IT program for the first time^[But nature hasn’t endowed us with them.]. These techniques can be learned. Today, the best thinking techniques are collected in systems thinking.

Applied disciplines (knowledge) deal with specific physical systems, which can be identified at different levels or scales. For example, a therapist works with the whole organism, while a neurobiologist works at the cellular level. Professionalism is the ability to solve a known class of problems quickly and well. For example, a professional swimmer can swim a certain distance, and a professional manager knows how to run an enterprise. To become a professional, you need to learn a specific applied method. A swimmer learns the freestyle technique, and a manager learns project management. It is professionalism (rather than intellect) that is well paid; professionals earn good money and recognition. Intellect, however, helps you become a professional more quickly. It is especially important when creating complex systems or when you need to retrain frequently or work in large teams.

Since we learn throughout our lives, conscious learning is extremely important. That’s why everyone needs, at the most basic level, to understand the importance of knowledge acquisition, the structure of any theory, the ability to choose the best knowledge, and to learn it quickly.
