# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.7. Form and Content

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material and use the AI bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your knowledge is not broad enough to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. If needed, create notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the “Notes” column, write down a reflection or a question that you can later ask in support chats.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
