# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.2. Discipline (Theory, Model)

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your knowledge is not broad enough to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Ask ChatGPT to provide a list of best practices in your field of activity, and record them in the table.

Provide examples from your work and personal projects by listing the main and other functions of the systems in your organization. Create notes as needed.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
