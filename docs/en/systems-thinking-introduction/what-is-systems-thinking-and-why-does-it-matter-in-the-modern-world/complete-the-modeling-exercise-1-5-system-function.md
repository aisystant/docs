# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.5. System Function

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material and use the AI-bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your perspective is too limited to find the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance.

Provide examples from your work and personal projects by listing the main and other functions of the systems in your organization. Make notes as needed.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
