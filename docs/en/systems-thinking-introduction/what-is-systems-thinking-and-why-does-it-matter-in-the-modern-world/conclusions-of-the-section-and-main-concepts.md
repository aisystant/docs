# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

Ordinary tasks are solved using applied mastery, but when the complexity of problems and tasks becomes overwhelming, intellect or thinking mastery comes into play.

Current trends show that people are increasingly confronted with new problems and complex tasks, and solving them requires taking into account a wide range of interests. Therefore, for intellect that demonstrates systems thinking, the following qualities are desirable:

* connecting different worldviews;
* the ability to solve complex problems across various fields of activity;
* continuously increasing the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory that can connect different worldviews. For this purpose, there is an intellect stack consisting of 16 transdisciplines, and an intellect equipped with this intellect stack delivers the function of systems thinking. Thanks to this, systems-oriented people are able to connect the diverse interests of stakeholders in a consistent way.

Key concepts: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classic properties of a system: integrity (of a system), emergent properties, nestedness; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, self-development practices, applied practices; systematicity, the use of a systems approach or systems thinking; applied mastery, thinking mastery, intellect, life mastery.
