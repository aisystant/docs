# Conduct Modeling: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery

Evaluate on a ten-point scale how much you learned thinking mastery at the university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you gained at AISYSTANT. The total cannot exceed 10 points for each transdiscipline (considering university, self-study, and AISYSTANT).

It's okay if you're not very familiar with all the transdisciplines of the intellect stack listed here; try to infer based on the brief descriptions provided in our course.

Indicate the year when your knowledge would be considered State of the Art (SoTA). For instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, then that year cannot be more recent than 1980.

Your assessment of current thinking mastery can take into account forgetting curves. If you excelled in a discipline in 2010 and would have rated yourself 10 points then, but haven't refreshed your mastery in that discipline sinceâ€”how many points do you have left?

Eventually, calculate the average level of your thinking mastery.

If necessary, jot down notes for further exploration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can record your reflections on what came to mind while filling out the table. This way, you can more consciously approach the development of your personal educational trajectory.

Locate the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
