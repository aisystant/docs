title: 'Conduct Modeling: 7.14. Level of Thinking Mastery'
---

Evaluate on a ten-point scale how much you have learned in thinking mastery at university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you gained from Aisystant. The total for each transdiscipline should not exceed 10 points (split across university, self-study, and Aisystant).

It's okay if you're not very familiar with all the listed transdisciplines of the intellect stack: try to infer based on the brief description provided in our course.

Indicate the year when your knowledge would qualify as state-of-the-art (SoTA). For instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, then that year cannot be newer than 1980.

Your assessment of current thinking mastery can account for forgetting curves. If you were an excellent student in a discipline in 2010 and would have rated yourself 10 points then, but haven't refreshed your mastery in that discipline sinceâ€”what level of proficiency remains?

Finally, calculate the average level of your thinking mastery.

As needed, create notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record your reflections on what came to mind when filling out the table. This will help you approach the formation of your personal education trajectory more consciously.

Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
