title: Organizational Units and Services
---

Work is carried out by organizational units. An organizational unit consists of agents (people, organizations, AI) equipped with materials and equipment at their disposal. The smallest organizational unit is a single employee hired for a specific position and managing the corresponding resources.

Typically, organizational units do not initiate activities on their own. In collaborative work, some organizational units have the authority to assign tasks to others, who are obliged to fulfill such requests. The entirety of organizational units with their mutual authorities forms an organization. A system of interest may be created by an expanded enterprise, which can include multiple organizations. Thus, legal or organizational-legal segmentation is just one possible description of a system-creator.

Each organizational unit performs external behavior that we refer to as a service. For example, there is an organizational unit within an enterprise that calculates salaries and another that disburses them. These are the services of salary calculation and disbursement. There are also assembly services, such as the assembly of a passenger vehicle. Organizational units can provide services to other organizational units or to the system of interest^[For example, the service of assembling a passenger vehicle.].

Work arises when an organizational unit is assigned a task and receives the necessary resources. After that, the organizational unit delivers the required service, resulting in a work artifact. If there is no assignment or resources, the service is not provided, and the work is not done.
