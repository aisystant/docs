# Organizational Units and Services

Work is carried out by organizational units. An organizational unit consists of agents (people, organizations, AI) along with the materials and equipment available to these agents. The smallest organizational unit is a single employee hired for a specific position, utilizing the resources available to them.

Typically, organizational units do not initiate work on their own. In collaborative activities, some organizational units have the authority to assign tasks to others, which are obliged to fulfill these requests. The entire set of organizational units with reciprocal authorities constitutes an organization. An expanded enterprise, which may include multiple organizations, can create the system of interest. Thus, legal or organizational-legal separation is one possible description of the system-creator.

Each organizational unit performs external activities, which we refer to as service. For example, there is an organizational unit within an enterprise responsible for calculating salaries, and there is another for distributing them. These are the salary calculation and distribution services. There are also assembly services, such as automobile assembly. Organizational units can provide services to other organizational units or to the system of interest[^1].

Work emerges when an organizational unit is given a task and receives the necessary resources. The organizational unit then delivers the required service, resulting in a work artifact. Until a task is assigned or resources are available, the service is not provided, and work is not completed.
