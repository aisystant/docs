# Perform Modeling: 7.5. Methods and System Levels

Fill in the "Method" column based on the following description: "Peter will need to deliver many presentations on the product in the coming six months. He is well-versed in the product he will be presenting, but feels somewhat unsure about his public speaking. He has broken down his presentation into system levels. Help him find a method for each system level so that he can select relevant training courses."

Make notes as needed for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write down a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
