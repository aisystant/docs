# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. Note that you have already encountered similar descriptions in textbooks. The table provides a brief summary, which is created at the beginning of a project and then used for further detail in other descriptions, as well as to ensure all team members share the same understanding. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

As needed, make notes for further refinement. You may not produce a good description right away, and you might need to revisit it more than once.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
