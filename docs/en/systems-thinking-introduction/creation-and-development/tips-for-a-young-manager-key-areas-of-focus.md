# Tips for Young Managers: Key Focus Areas

Taking on a managerial role is always a challenge, especially if you're new to managing people. You might be an excellent specialist—a marketer, engineer, or doctor. However, being a manager involves less about subject-matter expertise and more about understanding management. Ideally, this should be systems management [ ^1 ].

The methodology of systems management is universal, regardless of what you are managing: a small team of three people, a large production, or a multinational company. It's much easier to grasp the ideas of systems management with a small unit and then apply them as you grow.

For young managers just starting their journey in team management, it's vital to understand two key areas of work:

* operational activities;
* organizational development.

Of course, it's also essential to understand which product (system of interest) the company produces, but you likely have a good grasp of that already.

Operational activities are your foundation as the person responsible for day-to-day work. Your unit's work should run like clockwork. It's crucial that production happens on time, with the specified quality, and within the budget. For example, imagine a production line where every employee knows their role and performs it flawlessly, ensuring a seamless operation.

Organizational development arises when it comes to developing and upgrading your "production line." This might include implementing new work methods, using new tools, or changing the team structure to increase efficiency. For example, consider an IT company deciding to adopt a new work methodology like Agile, which can accelerate product development. A manager must not only motivate the team to embrace new methods but also exemplify adaptability and readiness for change.

As a manager, you need to inspire your staff to work in both directions and demonstrate high productivity and openness to innovations yourself. Your task is to build a team ready and able to engage in both operational activities and organizational development. Employees usually have a good understanding of operational activities but are not inclined towards organizational changes to the line they work on.

It's also important to work not just with your team but with your surroundings. Your efforts toward change may affect the entire organization, not just your unit. Therefore, it's crucial to have the support of your leadership and related departments. For example, if you manage the marketing department and see the need to improve client interaction processes, this may require collaboration with the product development, sales, and IT departments to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don't engage with your manager, they will engage with you and impose their agenda and ideas. Not all of them will be systems-oriented if your manager hasn't studied the systems methodology as you have. This means you need to actively participate in shaping your agenda by proposing your ideas and showing initiative. Your goal is to make your manager an ally and a like-minded partner in implementing the necessary changes.

In conclusion, remember that success as a manager depends on your ability to oversee current operations and your vision and ability to carry out systems changes. Be a leader who is not afraid of challenges and is ready for constant development—both your own and your team's.
