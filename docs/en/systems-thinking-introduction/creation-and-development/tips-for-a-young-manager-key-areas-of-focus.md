title: 'Tips for a Young Manager: Key Areas of Focus'

**Introduction**

Taking on the role of a manager is always a challenge, especially if you're new to managing people. You may be an excellent specialistâ€”be it a marketer, engineer, or physician. However, being a manager requires not just expertise in your specific field, but knowledge of management as well. And it's preferable that this knowledge includes understanding of systems management^[This is why it is recommended to take part in our core program "Organizational Development."].

The methodology of systems management is universal, regardless of what you are in charge of: a small team of three people, a large production line, or even a multinational company. It's much easier to grasp the ideas of systems management within a small department and then apply them as you scale up.

For young managers who are just beginning their journey in team management, it is crucial to understand two key areas of work:

- operational activities
- organizational development

Of course, it's also important to understand which product (system of interest) your company produces, although you likely already have a good grasp of this.

**Operational Activities**

Operational activities are your foundation as someone responsible for ongoing work. Your department should run like clockwork. It is essential that production is timely, of a certain quality, and within budget. For instance, imagine a production line where every employee knows their role and performs it flawlessly, ensuring seamless operation.

**Organizational Development**

Organizational development comes into play when discussing the improvement and modernization of your "production line." This may include implementing new work methods, utilizing new tools, or restructuring the team to enhance efficiency. For example, consider an IT company deciding to adopt a new work methodology, such as Agile, which will accelerate product development. The manager must not only motivate the team to embrace new methods but also set an example of adaptability and readiness for change.

As a leader, you need to inspire your employees to thrive in both areas and personally demonstrate high performance and openness to innovations. Your goal is to build a team that is ready and able to work in both spheres: operational activities and organizational development. Typically, employees are well-acquainted with operational activities but are less inclined to engage with organizational changes to the "production line" they work on.

**Working with Your Environment**

It's also crucial to collaborate not just with your team but with your surroundings. Your change efforts may affect not only your department but the entire organization. Therefore, it's vital to gain the support of your higher management and adjacent departments. For instance, if you manage a marketing department and see a need to improve client engagement processes, this may require cooperation with the product development, sales, and IT departments to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don't engage with your supervisor, they will engage with you, imposing their agenda and ideas. Not all of these will be systems-oriented if your supervisor hasn't delved into systemic methodology as you have. This means that you should actively participate in setting your agenda, offering your ideas and showing initiative. Your goal is to make your supervisor an ally and a like-minded partner in implementing necessary changes.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, remember that success in a managerial role depends on your ability to oversee current operations and your vision, as well as your ability to implement systems changes. Be a leader who isn't afraid of challenges and is ready for continuous personal and team development.
