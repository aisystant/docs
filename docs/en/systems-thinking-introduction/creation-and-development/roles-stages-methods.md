# Roles, Stages, Methods

Next, let's examine the relationship between stages, methods, and roles. The diagram shows the stagesâ€”design, manufacturing, and operation. At each stage, different roles may use different methods.

This allows us to see, from a functional perspective, how an enterprise that creates the system of interest actually operates. At each stage, different functional parts of the enterprise or organizational roles apply different methods.

| Roles/Stages | Design | Manufacturing | Operation |
| Entrepreneur | Lean startup, ... | Attracting investments, ... | Negotiation practitioner, ... |
| Engineer | Use case 2.0 | Assembly line, ... | Repair, ... |
| Manager | Case management, ... | Project management, ... | Process management, ... |

Choosing the main organizational methods is an important architectural decision about how the enterprise will be structured. This decision is made by the enterprise architect. Identifying the necessary methods and assigning them to the appropriate stages is practice (method) management.

A systems-oriented team always understands which method it is using to create the system of interest and does not overlook important methods that determine the enterprise's competitiveness. However, the team must include a performer in the role of practice manager^[The position may be called CTO (Chief Technology Officer).].
