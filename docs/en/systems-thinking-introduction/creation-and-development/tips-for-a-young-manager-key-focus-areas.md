# Tips for a Young Manager: Key Focus Areas

Stepping into a managerial role is always a challenge, especially if you are new to managing people. You might be an excellent specialist—a marketer, engineer, or doctor. But the role of a manager is less about expertise in a specific subject area and more about knowledge of management. Ideally, this should be systems management^[That’s why we recommend taking our core program, “Organizational Development.”].

The methodology of systems management is universal, no matter what you are leading: a small team of three, a large manufacturing operation, or a multinational corporation. It is much easier to grasp the ideas of systems management within a small unit, and then apply them as you grow.

For new managers just beginning their journey in team leadership, it is important to understand two key areas of work:

* operational activities;
* organizational development.

Of course, it is also important to understand what product (system of interest) your company delivers, but you likely already have a good grasp of that.

Operational activities are your foundation as the person responsible for day-to-day work. Your unit’s operations should run like clockwork. It is crucial that products are delivered on time, at the required quality, and within budget. For example, imagine a production line where every employee knows their role and performs it flawlessly, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted operations.

Organizational development comes into play when it’s time to improve and modernize your “production line.” This might involve introducing new work methods, adopting new tools, or changing the team structure to boost efficiency. For instance, consider an IT company deciding to adopt a new way of working, such as the Agile methodology, to accelerate product development. The manager must not only motivate the team to embrace new methods but also set an example of adaptability and readiness for change.

As a manager, you need to motivate employees to work in both areas and personally demonstrate high performance and openness to innovation. Your task is to build a team that is ready and able to work in both spheres—operational activities and organizational development. Usually, employees are well aware of operational activities but are not at all inclined toward organizational changes to the production line they work on.

It is also important to work not only with your team but with your surroundings. Your efforts to implement change may affect not just your unit but the entire organization. That’s why it is crucial to have the support of your superiors and related departments. For example, if you manage the marketing department and see a need to improve client processes, this may require collaboration with the product development, sales, and IT departments to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don’t manage your boss, your boss will manage you and push their own agenda and ideas. Not all of these will be systems-oriented if your boss hasn’t studied the systems methodology as you have. This means you should actively participate in shaping your own agenda, proposing your ideas, and showing initiative. Your goal is to turn your boss into an ally and like-minded partner in driving necessary changes.

In conclusion, remember that success in a managerial role depends on your ability to manage current operations as well as your vision and skill in implementing systems changes. Be a leader who is not afraid of challenges and is ready for continuous development—both your own and that of your team.
