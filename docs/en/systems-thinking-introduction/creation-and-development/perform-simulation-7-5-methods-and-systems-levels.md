# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.5. Methods and System Levels

Fill in the “Method” column based on the following description: “Andrew needs to deliver multiple presentations of the product over the next six months. He has a good understanding of the product he will present, but feels somewhat insecure about his public speaking skills. He has broken down his presentation into system levels. Help him find a method for each system level, so he can select appropriate courses to attend.”

As needed, make notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the “Notes” column, you might jot down a question to ask in the support chat or write a thought for future preparation.

Locate the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.
