# Why and How to Explain Systems Thinking

You’ve likely heard the famous quote by Ernest Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics and a Nobel laureate: “If a scientist can’t explain their work to the cleaning lady at the lab, then they themselves don’t understand what they do.”

This quote raises an important question: why be able to explain systems thinking to everyday people (colleagues, children, followers)? Isn’t it a waste of time and effort?

The answers to these questions extend any subject's curriculum, and consequently, your self-development, meaning the development of your personality as a system. Regardless of what you study or engage in—be it physics, systems thinking, or AI—you initially focus more on theory before moving heavily towards practice. You might feel that you know many systems concepts, principles, and thinking techniques, yet with each revisit to theory, you approach the previously learned with a new neural network and notice something unusual, deepening your understanding.

When you explain complex topics to people, you revisit what you have studied and test your knowledge in explaining work or life situations^[You essentially test your neural network’s ability to explain the world, as systems thinking is also a worldview—the ability to see the world.]. By explaining systems thinking to others, you:

* continue layering your knowledge (like a second coat of paint) because, as the saying goes, “To understand better, explain it to another”;
* gain better insights into your activities, enhancing your agency and understanding why you invest so much time in complex knowledge, maintaining constant grounding;
* literally create like-minded individuals among your loved ones^[You’ll particularly feel that your loved ones share a similar worldview with you.] and colleagues (influencing them), allowing you to collaborate on work and personal projects in the future;
* engage in enlightening others and making a positive impact if you post on social media, sharing your experiences, and popularizing systems thinking.

Here’s one explanation of systems thinking as a worldview that you can adopt.

When you enter an apartment, you quickly get your bearings. You’re familiar with certain terminology to see much yourself or ask the necessary questions. You know what a kitchen is, how a bath differs from a shower, what communal living is, etc. Therefore, you can make numerous decisions whether you’re a buyer or seller, tenant or guest, manager or plumber.

Similarly, systems thinking helps quickly understand any human activity, discerning what is what and how everything connects. Consider, for instance, identifying the equivalent of ‘sellers’, ‘realtors,’ or ‘burglars’. Systems thinking is a "prism" through which you can view work projects, your enterprise, or your life. Not only view it but change the world as well.

This “prism” or worldview does not develop overnight. Our brains need to literally grow new connections. Still, if you study relevant courses and apply this knowledge in real life, systems thinking develops more swiftly compared to the time you subconsciously spent learning about the real estate market. While you might know a lot about this market, you probably know less than a professional. Many understand their work activities, but this doesn’t usually encompass a systems perspective.

Fluent systems thinking operates just like any worldview. You could arrive at a new enterprise and understand everything there as if in an apartment. Yet knowing the ‘apartment issue’ doesn’t mean you can easily undertake a repair or install new windows. Similarly, systems thinking is not a panacea; you’ll also need applied methods. But you’ll already understand that for "new windows," you need one set of suppliers, and for "installing an extractor," another. Any enterprise’s activities will be as conceptually mapped for you as any apartment.

Many adults likely understand how to renovate an apartment and where to start: what comes first and what follows. If needed, anyone could easily write three to five paragraphs on what to pay attention to in any apartment or how to repair it. Likewise, a systems-oriented person knows where to look first, and as they proceed through the main AISYSTANT program, they learn how to improve any system and activity. Thus, they become the Chief Transformation Officer of themselves, their family, or the team within the enterprise, and possibly further, for the community and society.

I hope you can better understand the brief description in the first subsection, "How Systems Thinking Aids in Work Activities." Based on this text and your experiences, you can compose your personal explanations of what systems thinking is. In doing so, you will continuously improve your mastery of systems thinking.
