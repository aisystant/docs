# Systems Thinking as a Method for Achieving Work on Creating a Successful System

This subsection concludes the substantive examination of the system thinking concepts, and therefore we will consolidate everything covered in the previous sections here. It will be particularly important to understand how a team uses the 3x3 Table in project activities.

As you already know, this table draws the team's attention to the most important aspects to consider in project activities.

The table is built on the interconnected areas of interest of the three main systems and the three main roles. Each cell in the 3x3 Table contains various subjects of interest in different systems, lists roles and methods, and provides examples of work artifacts (documentation) that need to be developed during the process of working on the system of interest.

When working on the system of interest, it is essential to keep in mind and consider several system levels and creation chains. You might be working with "our system," which can be a subsystem of the system of interest or the system-creator. Or within your activity, it may be necessary not only to create or develop the system of interest but also to implement organizational changes in the organization.

There are many teams that create and develop successful systems (systems of interest and system-creators), yet they do not fully utilize a systems approach. The fact is, creating and developing systems ultimately involves certain works carried out by executor agents with resources. These works do not necessarily have to be defined in a systems way. For example, they can be done through experience, trial and error, etc. Moreover, if you have a lot of resources, you will still create a successful system: you can always attract the best agents, buy the best tools, and verify your hypotheses as many times as needed. Therefore, large companies and market leaders have more chances to survive than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one way of achieving work, but it is far from the only one. However, applying systems thinking provides a chance to outperform leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in a shorter time frame and with a smaller budget. Although the probability is, of course, not 100%. Nonetheless, systems thinking techniques allow obtaining the necessary works based on systems modeling, which is described in the 3x3 Table. It's a kind of checklist for what you must not forget in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

We do not speak of a 100% probability of success because, firstly, this checklist only contains hypotheses. For example, hypotheses regarding customer dissatisfaction or the system architecture hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis verification cycle will still need to be run, and this applies to all cells of the 3x3 Table. Secondly, to create the corresponding work artifacts, applied methods and professional performers are required. Nevertheless, systems thinking provides fundamental clarity regarding where to start when faced with something new and complex.

In the end, systems thinking demonstrates why certain work is necessary, what is expected in terms of results, and sets the trend for subsequent actions. All this reduces chaos in the mind and instills confidence in one's actions.
