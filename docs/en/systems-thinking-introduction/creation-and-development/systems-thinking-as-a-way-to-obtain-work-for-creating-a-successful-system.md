# Systems Thinking as a Way to Obtain Work for Creating a Successful System

### Conclusion of the Section: Systems Thinking Concepts

This subsection concludes the substantive examination of systems thinking concepts, bringing together insights from previous sections. A key focus is on how the team utilizes the 3x3 Table in project activities.

As you already know, this table directs the team's attention to the most critical aspects to consider in project activities.

The table is structured on the relationship between the areas of interest of three primary systems and three main roles. Each cell in the 3x3 Table gathers various subjects of interest related to different systems, enumerates roles and methods, and provides examples of work artifacts (system documentation) that should be developed during work on the system of interest.

While working on the system of interest, it is essential to consider several system levels and creation chains. You might engage with "our system," which could be a subsystem of the system of interest or the system-creator. Alternatively, your activities may require not only creating or developing the system of interest but also implementing organizational changes within the organization.

There are many teams that create and develop successful systems (systems of interest and system-creators) without fully employing a systems approach. Ultimately, the creation and development of systems involve specific tasks carried out by executor-agents with resources. These tasks do not necessarily need to be determined systematically. For instance, they can be derived from experience, trial and error, etc. Moreover, with ample resources, you can still create a successful system by hiring the best agents, acquiring the best tools, and repeatedly testing your hypotheses. This is why large companies and market leaders have a better chance of survival than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one method of accomplishing these tasks, but it is not the only one. Applying systems thinking offers a chance to surpass leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in a shorter time and with a smaller budget. Although the probability is not 100%, systems thinking techniques enable the execution of necessary tasks based on systems modeling, as outlined in the 3x3 Table. It serves as a kind of checklist to ensure nothing is overlooked in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

We're not claiming a 100% probability of success, partly because this checklist contains merely hypothesesâ€”such as client dissatisfaction hypotheses or the system architecture hypothesis. Thus, the cycle of hypothesis validation will still be necessary, which applies to all cells of the 3x3 Table. Furthermore, creating relevant work artifacts will require applied methods and professional executors. Nevertheless, systems thinking provides foundational clarity on where to begin when faced with something new and complex.

In conclusion, systems thinking demonstrates why certain tasks are necessary, what results are expected, and sets the trend for subsequent actions. This approach reduces mental chaos and boosts confidence in one's actions.
