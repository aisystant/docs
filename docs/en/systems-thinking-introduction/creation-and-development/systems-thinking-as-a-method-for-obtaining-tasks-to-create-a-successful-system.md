# Systems Thinking as a Method for Achieving Success in System Creation

This subsection concludes the substantive analysis of systems thinking concepts, thus we will consolidate everything covered in the previous sections. Understanding how the team uses the 3x3 Table in project activities is particularly important.

As you already know, this table directs the team's attention to the most important aspects to consider in project activities.

The table is constructed based on the relationship between the areas of interest of three main systems and three main roles. Each cell of the 3x3 Table collects different subjects of interest for different systems, lists roles and methods, and provides examples of work artifacts (system documentation) that must be developed while working on the system of interest.

In the process of working on the system of interest, it is necessary to consider several system levels and creation chains. You might be working with "our system," which could be a subsystem of the system of interest or a system-creator. Or your activity might require not only the creation or development of the system of interest but also implementing organizational changes within the organization.

There are many teams that create and develop successful systems (systems of interest and system-creators) without fully employing a systems approach. This is because the creation and development of systems ultimately involve executing specific tasks by executor-agents with resources. These tasks do not necessarily need to be defined through a systems approach. For example, they can be determined from experience, by trial and error, etc. Moreover, if you have many resources, you will create a successful system in one way or another: you can always attract the best agents, buy the best tools, and repeatedly test your hypotheses. Therefore, large companies and market leaders have a higher likelihood of survival than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one method for achieving successful system creation, but it is certainly not the only one. However, employing systems thinking provides a chance to outperform leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in a shorter time frame and with a smaller budget. Although the probability is, of course, not 100%. Nevertheless, the techniques of systems thinking allow one to derive necessary tasks from system modeling, as described in the 3x3 Table. It acts as a checklist of what must not be forgotten in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

We do not promise a 100% success rate because, firstly, this checklist contains only hypotheses. For example, hypotheses about client dissatisfaction or the hypothesis of system architecture. Thus, the cycle of testing hypotheses will still have to be rotated, and this applies to all cells of the 3x3 Table. Secondly, creating the corresponding work artifacts will require applied methods and professional executors. Nevertheless, systems thinking offers fundamental clarity about where to start when faced with something new and complex.

Ultimately, systems thinking demonstrates why certain tasks need to be performed, what is expected as a result, and sets the trend for subsequent actions. This reduces chaos in the mind and boosts confidence in one's actions.
