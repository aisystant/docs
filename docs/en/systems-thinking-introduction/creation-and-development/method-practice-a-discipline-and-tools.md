# Method (Practice) – Discipline and Tools

In systems thinking, a practice or method can be described as a combination of discipline and the tools that support that discipline. Accordingly, a practice implemented within an enterprise consists of agents proficient in theory and using tools to perform specific roles. Note that individuals must study the discipline and train themselves in using the tools.

Examples of disciplines include accounting, hairdressing theory, marketing, or operational management (usually, textbooks are written about these disciplines). A discipline is learned or “put into” the mind, whereas tools are additionally mastered or trained for usage. Unlike discipline, tools exist in the physical world [ ^1 ]. A tool is a device or object that helps create a work artifact. In the given examples, tools include scissors and the SAP software system (1C:Accounting). Specific discipline is embedded "inside" tools [ ^2 ]. Therefore, if you are developing technology, it will likely be used by a role according to a specific discipline as a tool. As the developer of this tool, you must have a good understanding of the discipline within which the role will work using this tool.

For instance, a person training to become an accountant studies accounting theory and learns SAP as a tool for accounting. When assigned work, they adopt the role of an accountant and use accounting practice to create a balance sheet and income statement. These documents are the work artifacts created following the rules laid out in accounting theory. The 1C program supports this theory and aids in creating work artifacts. Within the SAP (1C) development team, there must be highly qualified accountants in addition to programmers.

Interestingly, instead of SAP, other tools could be used—like Excel and Word. The theory remains unchanged, only the tool changes. Try to reflect on the topic of discipline and tools concerning your professional methods (practices).

Every organization can be viewed as a collection or combination of numerous methods. No two people are alike due to their unique genetic makeup, nor are there identical organizations. Each enterprise has its own set of practices, defining its competitiveness and, consequently, its survival. As organizations evolve, they can discover and formalize new work methods, which then replicate like genes. Other enterprises adopt and implement these best practices, literally passing on memes.

Each area of interest outlined in the 3x3 Table applies its own organizational methods. This pertains to describing the target audience, attracting investors, defining the architecture, or outlining the creation systems. For the relevant work artifacts in each cell of the 3x3 Table, corresponding methods are required. If your architectural practices are excellent but your marketing ones are poor (or vice versa), your enterprise is unlikely to be competitive. The 3x3 Table helps ensure you don't forget the necessary practices in the organization, but it also allows you to mark cells where you excel market-leading practices and those areas of interests—satisfactory.

Competitiveness is achieved when your organization excels in some area while working satisfactorily in all other areas of interest relative to the market. However, if you have a deficiency somewhere, even your best practices may be useless. Similarly, if all areas are in a consistently moderate state, often referred to as “a solid B,” you are unlikely to become a market leader.

Therefore, attention to organizational methods is a vital part of the work of a Chief Transformation Officer, specifically in the role of an organizational designer. They are responsible for the concept of the organization (as a system), defining functional roles and their interactions, as well as designing changes within the organization. Organizational designers may also be responsible for defining the authorities and responsibilities of organizational units and preparing the organizational project.
