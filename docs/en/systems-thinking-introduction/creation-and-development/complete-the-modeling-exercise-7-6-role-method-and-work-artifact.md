# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.6. Role, Method, and Work Artifact

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work artifact, it is sufficient to provide an example of just one role. You do not need to include full names, or you may list well-known individuals. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with expert acquaintances. Write down the last names of three of your colleagues and match them with the project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Next, list at least three of your own project roles, the methods you use, and the work artifacts you produce.

As needed, create notes for further elaboration. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
