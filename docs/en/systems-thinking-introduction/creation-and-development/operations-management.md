# Work Management

Work management differs from practice management. Practice management involves focusing on the methods (practices) used to create all work artifacts according to the 3x3 Table. It's essential to determine which practices are necessary, establish them in the organization, and monitor their relevance. Conversely, work management is based on established practice management.

Work management (operation management or operational activities) involves allocating resources to implement plans on time and within budget. Here, work phases emerge, which, as you know, differ from logical stages where practices follow one another [ ^1 ]. However, detailed phase planning is becoming less common as life quickly introduces changes. Only the upcoming phase is planned in detail, while all subsequent phases are envisioned with significant assumptions, as circumstances are likely to change significantly by the time work on these phases begins.

Practice management is an engineering discipline, requiring a solid understanding of engineering work practices. In contrast, work management is purely a managerial discipline, demanding proficiency in operational management.

Work management abstracts from the engineering nature of operations, that is, from systems modeling, the results of which are generally represented in the 3x3 Table. All work within project activities or at the enterprise level is connected to the areas of interest in some way.

Knowledge about ways of executing work is not particularly needed by an operational manager. The manager's goal is to achieve the fastest and cheapest completion of work to produce a work artifact based on systems modeling. Managerial methods are used specifically for this purpose. For instance, if the productivity of an assembly line is insufficient, the manager decides to install several more machines. It doesn't matter to them what kind of processing the machine performs or whether it can be done using other methods and tools. They alleviate the bottleneck with a managerial approach. However, seeking another practice to solve the same productivity problem is part of practice management or an organizational development project managed by the Chief Transformation Officer [ ^2 ].

Work management encompasses various practices, such as project management, process management, and case management. Each practice is characterized by its own set of interests and a corresponding method for describing the workflow. Nevertheless, they all share a main goalâ€”to accelerate the workflow while minimizing costs.

Project management involves up-front planning, including checkpoints, resources, the start and end times, production rates, and more. For example, project management is well-suited for building construction when a Bridge Bureau has prepared the project documentation. Builders simply need to perform the necessary work at specific stages.

Process management involves uniform work, a standard sequence of steps usually determined more by regulation than by plan. Process management can be used during the operation phase of the same building. Here, processes such as cleaning, waste removal, and scheduled maintenance are clearly evident.

Case management is a more modern approach to work management. A case is a situation, circumstance, or endeavor that requires a set of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject of interest that the actions are performed upon. For example, a person, a legal case, or an insurance claim. A case depends on emerging circumstances since it's impossible to calculate all work in advance. Case management is convenient to apply during the stages of conceptualization and design, as they are difficult to plan, yet work must be managed. The concept of a case is particularly useful here.

[ ^1 ]: For example, first comes the cleaning and plastering of a wall, followed by painting, not the other way around.
[ ^2 ]: Any problem can be addressed with engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For instance, one could change the way the work is done, add resources and performers, or choose to focus on another issue instead.
