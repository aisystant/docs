# Operations Management

**Managing Work vs. Managing Practices**

Managing practices involves focusing on the methods (practices) used to create all work artifacts, as outlined in Table 3x3. It requires understanding which practices are necessary, establishing them within the organization, and monitoring their relevance. In contrast, managing work is built upon established practice management.

**Work Management (operation management or operational activities)** involves allocating resources to implement plans on time and within budget. Work stages differ from logical stages, where practices follow one another^[For example, wall cleaning and plastering occur before painting, not vice versa.]. Nowadays, comprehensive planning for all stages is rare, given the dynamic nature of life. Only the upcoming stage is planned in detail, with subsequent stages considered with significant assumptions, as situations will likely change by the time work on these stages begins.

Managing practices is considered an engineering discipline that requires knowledge of engineering work practices, whereas managing work is strictly a managerial discipline, focusing on operational management.

Work management abstracts from the engineering essence of operations, such as systems modeling, whose results are broadly represented in Table 3x3. All project activities or enterprise-level work are somehow connected to areas of interest.

Knowledge of work execution methods is not particularly necessary for an operations manager, whose goal is to achieve the fastest, most cost-effective work completion to produce a work artifact based on systems modeling. This involves using management techniques. For instance, if a conveyor line's productivity is insufficient, the manager decides to add more machines. It doesn't matter what processing the machine performs or if it can be done using another method or tool. The bottleneck is resolved through a managerial approach. However, finding an alternative practice for the same productivity issue is a task for practice management or an organizational development project, typically handled by the Chief Transformation Officer^[Any problem can be solved using engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For example, one can change the way of working, add resources and executors, or choose not to address the problem and focus on another.].

Work management comprises various practices, such as project management, process management, and case management. Each practice is characterized by its own set of interests and relevant method of describing the workflow. However, they all share the primary goal of accelerating the workflow while minimizing costs.

**Project Management** involves upfront planning, including checkpoints, resources, start and end times, production standards, etc. It is well-suited for building construction, where the project office has prepared project documentation. Builders just need to perform the necessary work by specific stages.

**Process Management** deals with standardized tasks, a typical sequence of steps usually determined not so much by a plan but by regulations. Process management is useful during the operation stage of the same building, where processes such as cleaning, garbage removal, planned maintenance, etc., are evident.

**Case Management** is a more contemporary way of managing work. A case is a situation, circumstance, or initiative that requires a set of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject of actions, such as a person, legal case, or insurance claim. A case relies on emerging circumstances of the affair, as it's impossible to pre-plan every task. Case management is convenient during the lifecycle stages of conception and design, where planning is tough but work must be managed. The case concept is particularly helpful here.
