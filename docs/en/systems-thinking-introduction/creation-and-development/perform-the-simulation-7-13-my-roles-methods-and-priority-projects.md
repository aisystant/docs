title: 'Perform the Simulation: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects'
---

Fill in the blank lines with your main roles from work and personal projects. Provide at least 10 examples of roles. Try to cover all your work projects and areas of life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you perform well, the more likely you have an interesting life. Ultimately, calculate the average level of applied mastery. Formulate notes for further development, if necessary. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for future preparation.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
