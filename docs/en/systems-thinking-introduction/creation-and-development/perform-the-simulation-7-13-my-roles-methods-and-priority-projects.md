# Perform Modeling: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects

Fill the empty lines with your main roles from work and personal projects. Provide examples of at least 10 roles. Try to cover all your work projects and all areas of life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you execute with quality, the more likely you have an interesting life. At the end, calculate the average level of role-based mastery. Formulate notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a question to ask in a support chat or jot down a thought for future preparation.

Find the corresponding task number in your modeling workspace and complete all its points.
