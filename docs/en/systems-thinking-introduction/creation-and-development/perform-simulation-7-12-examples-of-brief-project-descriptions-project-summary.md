# Perform the Modeling: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)

Examine the examples in the first rows of the table. Notice that such textual descriptions have already appeared in your textbooks. The table provides a brief description that is created at the beginning of a project and is later used for elaboration in other descriptions, as well as for ensuring understanding among all team members. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

As needed, create notes for further development. You may not immediately produce a good description and might need to revisit it multiple times.

In your modeling workspace, locate the corresponding assignment by its number and complete all its components.
