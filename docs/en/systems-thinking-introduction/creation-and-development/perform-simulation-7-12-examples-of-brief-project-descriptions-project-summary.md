# Perform Simulation: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)

Study the examples in the first rows of the table. Note that a similar text description has already appeared in your textbooks. The table provides a brief description that is made at the beginning of the project and is later used for further detailing in other descriptions as well as for aligning the understanding of all team members. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

If necessary, make notes for further refinement. It's possible that you may not create a strong description right away, and you might need to revisit it several times.

Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
