# Perform Modeling: 7.6. Role, Method, and Work Product

Review the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work artifact, it is sufficient to provide an example of one role. You don't need to mention full names, or you can mention people you're familiar with. If you lack the insight to choose the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with known experts for this purpose. Write down the last names of three of your colleagues and match them with the project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Then list at least three of your own project roles, methods, and work artifacts.

If necessary, create notes for follow-up work. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in the support chat, or record a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
