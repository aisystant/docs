# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.6. Role, Method, and Work Artifact

Review the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work artifact, it is sufficient to provide an example of one role. Full names are not necessary, or you can mention well-known individuals. If your perspective is not broad enough to select appropriate words and labels (names), use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with familiar experts. List the names of three of your colleagues and align them with the project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Then list at least three of your own project roles, methods, and work artifacts.

Make notes for further exploration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you could write down a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its parts.
