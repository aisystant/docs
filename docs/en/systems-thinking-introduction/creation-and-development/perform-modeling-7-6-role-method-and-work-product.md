# Conduct Modeling: 7.6. Role, Method, and Work Artifact

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work artifact, it is sufficient to provide an example of one role. Providing full names is optional, or you may mention well-known people you are aware of. If you lack the expertise to select the appropriate words and designations (names), you may use ChatGPT or Google, or discuss with knowledgeable experts. Write down the last names of three of your colleagues and match them with project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Next, list at least three of your project roles, methods, and work artifacts.

Create notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you might write down a question to ask in the support chat, or record a thought for future preparation.

Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
