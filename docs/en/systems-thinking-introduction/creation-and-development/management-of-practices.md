# Management of Practices

**Managing Work vs. Managing Practices**

Managing work is a fully managerial practice, while managing practices is half-engineering and half-managerial. A practice manager should not be confused with a developer or the architect of the system itself, even though they also engage in engineering work. Their focus is on the methods and practices within the engineers' work on the system of interest, including what practices developers and architects employ.

Managing practices involves selecting the necessary methods and structuring the work around them within the organization.

A method manager ensures the integrity of the configuration of methods, verifies, and supports the use of methods and tools. It is worth noting that a method manager often holds the position of CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and/or CIO (Chief Information Officer). They possess a deep understanding of the practices that lead to the successful creation of a system. The method manager must be well-versed in those technological operations and services that will support the creation systems to build the system of interest. They also establish the logical sequence of practice implementation, including identifying stages.

Managing practices answers the question, "How does the organization operate to produce a successful system?" This practice is engineering in the aspect that it involves practices as functional and role behaviors of the creation system. However, it also defines the structure of the system-creator, and thus is considered in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 table.

Unlike trees or birds^[Biological and natural systems develop independently, with their development embedded through evolution. In contrast, engineering systems require the participation of engineers.], a car and a house will not build themselves, nor will a rocket launch itself into space. Someone must specify which methods and means to use and in what sequence. This is the role of method managers. Their focus is on creation systems, and their work artifact is practitioners trained in practices and equipped with supporting technologies/tools.

A practice manager should not be confused with an enterprise architect. The latter is concerned with the modular organization of the enterpriseâ€”into which organizational units it should be divided so that these units can be assigned to the relevant practices. However, which practices they will be, their completeness, and the logical sequence of implementation are the interests of the practice manager. They engage in substantive discussions on methods of engineering work.
