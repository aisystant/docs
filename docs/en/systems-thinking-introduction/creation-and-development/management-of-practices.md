# Managing Practices

Managing work activities is a fully managerial practice, while managing practices is both an engineering and managerial one. A practices manager should not be confused with the developer or architect of the system itself, even though they also engage in engineering work. Their focus is on the methods and work practices of the engineers of the system of interest, including which practices are employed by developers and architects.

Management of practices involves selecting necessary methods and organizing work according to them within the organization.

The methods manager ensures the integrity of method configurations, checks, and supports the use of methods and tools. It is noteworthy that the methods manager often works in the position of CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and/or CIO (Chief Information Officer). They possess a deep understanding of practices that lead to the successful creation of a system. The methods manager must be well-acquainted with those technological operations and services that will support the creation systems to enable the formation of the system of interest. They also establish the logical sequence of implementing practices, including identifying phases.

Managing practices answers the question: "How does the organization operate to produce a successful system?" This practice is engineering-focused to the extent that it deals with practices as functional and role-based behaviors of the creation system. However, this practice also defines the structure of the system-creator, and thus it is considered in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 Table.

Unlike a tree or a bird^[Biological, natural systems develop independently, as their development is embedded by evolution. Engineering systems, on the other hand, require the participation of engineers.], a car and a house will not build themselves, nor will a rocket launch itself into space. Someone has to specify the methods and techniques to use and in which sequence. This is the role of the methods managers. The methods manager's focus is on creation systems, and their work artifact is skilled individuals trained in practices and the technologies/tools provided to support them.

The practices manager should not be confused with the enterprise architect. The latter is concerned with questions of the modular structure of the enterprise, such as how to divide it into organizational units to assign these units to corresponding practices. However, what these practices will be, their completeness, and the logical sequence of their execution are the interests of the practices manager. They engage in substantive discussions of engineering work methods.
