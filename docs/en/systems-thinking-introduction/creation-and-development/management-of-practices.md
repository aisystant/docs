# Practice Management

Managing tasks is entirely a managerial practice, while managing practices is both an engineering and a managerial practice. The practice manager should not be confused with the developer or architect of the system itself, even though he is also involved in engineering work. His focus is on the methods and practices used by the engineers of the system of interest, including which practices are equipped by developers and architects.

Practice management involves selecting the necessary methods and organizing work around them within the organization.

The method manager ensures the integrity of the methods configuration, checks, and maintains the use of methods and tools. It is worth noting that the method manager often works as a CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and/or CIO (Chief Information Officer). They possess a deep understanding of practices leading to successful system creation. The method manager should be well-versed in the technological operations and services that will support the creation systems to develop the system of interest. Moreover, they organize the logical sequence of implementing practices, including identifying stages.

Practice management answers the question, "how does the organization function to successfully produce a system?" This practice is engineering to the extent that it involves practices as functional and role-based behaviors of the creation system. However, this practice determines the structure of the system-creator and is therefore discussed in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 Table.

Unlike a tree or a bird [^1], a car and a house will not build themselves, and a rocket will not launch itself into space. Someone must specify the methods and means and in what sequence to do so. This is what method managers do. The method manager's (practices managerâ€™s) attention is directed toward the creation systems, and their work artifact is the people trained in practices and the technologies/tools provided to support them.

Do not confuse the practice manager with the enterprise architect. The latter is concerned with questions of the enterprise's modular design, such as into which organizational units to divide it so that these units can be assigned to relevant practices. However, determining what these practices will be, their completeness, and logical execution sequence is the interest of the practice manager. They engage in substantive discussions of engineering work methods.
