# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.3. Role Performer Qualification

Recall your last three conversations with colleagues and fill in the table. Rate the qualification on a ten-point scale, where 0 means "does not possess the method at all, cannot do anything," and 10 means "masters the method better than anyone in the world, can do everything in this method with consistently excellent results."

As needed, create notes for further review.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
