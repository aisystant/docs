# Why and How to Explain What Systems Thinking Is

You may have heard the famous quote from Ernest Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics and a Nobel Prize laureate: "If a scientist can't explain to the janitor who cleans their lab what their work means, then they do not really understand what they are doing."

This quote raises an important question: why should we be able to explain systems thinking to everyday people (colleagues, children, followers)? Isn't it a waste of time and effort?

The answers to these questions continue any subject's educational program and, accordingly, your self-development, meaning the development of your personality as a system. Regardless of what you study or do—be it physics, systems thinking, or AI—you first focus more on theory and then strongly engage in practice. You might think you know many systems concepts, principles, and thinking techniques, but with each return to theory, you look at what seems already studied with a new neural network and notice something unusual, deepening your understanding.

When you explain complex topics to people, you revisit what you've learned and test your knowledge by explaining some work or life situations [ ^1 ]. By explaining systems thinking to others, you:

* Continue to layer your knowledge (like a second coat of paint), since, as the saying goes: "If you want to understand better, explain to someone else."
* Gain a better understanding of the meaning of your activities, increase your agency, and comprehend why you invest so much time in complex knowledge. In other words, you experience constant grounding.
* Literally begin to create like-minded individuals among your close friends [ ^2 ] and colleagues (influencing them), and you can implement work and personal projects with them in the future.
* Engage in enlightenment and make the world better if you publish posts on social media, sharing your experiences and popularizing systems thinking.

Here is one explanation of systems thinking as a worldview that you can use.

When you enter an apartment, you quickly find your bearings. You have a certain terminology to see many things for yourself or to ask necessary questions. You know what a kitchen is, how a bath differs from a shower, what a communal apartment is, and so on. Therefore, you can make many decisions, whether you're a buyer, seller, renter, guest, manager, or plumber.

Similarly, systems thinking helps quickly understand any human activity and discern what is what and how everything is interconnected. For example, who might be the "sellers," "realtors," or "burglars" in a given context. Systems thinking acts as a "prism" through which you can view work projects, your enterprise, or your life. And not just view, but change the world.

This "prism" or worldview doesn't develop over a couple of months. Our brain literally needs to grow new connections. However, if you study relevant courses and apply this knowledge in real life, systems thinking develops faster compared to the overall time you've unconsciously spent learning about the real estate market. Even if you know a lot about this market, you most likely know less than a professional. After all, many know about their work activities, but it is unlikely to be a systems perspective.

Fluent systems thinking functions just like any worldview. For instance, you enter a new enterprise, and everything is as clear to you as if it were an apartment. However, knowing about apartments does not mean you can easily do renovations or install new windows. Similarly, systems thinking is not a panacea, and in addition to it, applied methods are needed. But you'll already know that for "new windows" you need certain suppliers, and for "exhaust installation," others. For you, any enterprise activity is conceptually marked as any apartment is.

Many adults likely understand how a renovation is done in an apartment and where to start: the initial steps and what follows. If needed, each could easily write three to five paragraphs on what to pay attention to in any apartment or how to renovate it. So it is with a systems thinker, who knows where to look first and, as they progress through the main AISYSTANT program, learns how to improve any system and activity. Thus, they become the Chief Transformation Officer of themselves, their family, or enterprise team, and possibly, the community and society.

I hope you can better understand the brief description in the first subsection "How Systems Thinking Helps in Work Activities." Based on this text and your experience, you can develop your personal explanations of what systems thinking is. This way, you will endlessly improve in the mastery of systems thinking.

[ ^1 ]: You are testing your neural network's ability to explain the world, as systems thinking is also a worldview, meaning the ability to look at the world.
[ ^2 ]: You especially feel that close ones share a similar worldview with you.
