# Method (Practice) – Discipline and Tools

In systems thinking, a practice or method can be seen as a combination of discipline and the tools that support this discipline. Accordingly, a practice implemented within an enterprise involves agents who possess the theory and tools necessary to perform specific roles. It is essential that individuals learn the discipline and practice using the tools.

Examples of disciplines include accounting or hairdressing theory, as well as marketing or operational management (textbooks are often written for these disciplines). A discipline is studied or "placed" in one’s mind, while tools are additionally mastered or practiced for use. Unlike discipline, tools exist in the physical world [ ^1 ]. A tool is a device or object that assists in creating a work artifact. In the given examples, the tools are scissors and the SAP software system (1C-accounting). Specific discipline is embedded "within" tools [ ^2 ].

For instance, a person training to be an accountant studies accounting theory and learns how to use SAP as a tool for accounting. When tasked with work, this person assumes the role of an accountant and, using accounting practices, creates a balance sheet and an income statement. These documents are the work artifacts created according to accounting theory's rules. The 1C program supports this theory and helps create work artifacts. The SAP (1C) development team must include not only programmers but also highly skilled accountants.

Incidentally, instead of SAP, other tools such as Excel and Word could be used. While the theory remains unchanged, the tool changes. Consider reflecting on discipline and tools concerning your professional methods (practices).

Any organization can be regarded as a combination or mixture of numerous methods. Just as no two people have the same genetic makeup, no two organizations are identical. Each enterprise has its unique set of practices that determine competitiveness and, consequently, the organization's viability. During development, organizations may discover and formalize new ways of working, which are later replicated, much like genes. Other enterprises adopt and implement best practices, effectively transmitting memes.

Each area of interest in the 3x3 Table applies its organizational methods. This pertains to describing the target audience, attracting investors, defining architecture, or outlining the creation systems. Each cell in the 3x3 Table requires corresponding methods for the relevant work artifacts. If you have excellent architectural practices but poor marketing ones (or vice versa), your enterprise is unlikely to be competitive. The 3x3 Table helps ensure that necessary organizational practices are not forgotten, and it also allows you to highlight cells where you will have the best market practices and others where the practices are merely satisfactory.

Competitiveness is achieved by excelling in specific areas while performing satisfactorily across other areas of interest relative to the market. However, a shortfall in any area can render even your best practices redundant. Similarly, if all areas are in a moderate state, described as "average," then it's improbable you'll become a market leader.

Thus, focus on organizational methods is an essential part of the Chief Transformation Officer’s work, particularly in the role of an organizational designer. This involves developing the concept of the organization (as a system), defining functional roles and their interactions, and designing changes within the organization. Organizational designers may also be responsible for defining authorities and responsibilities of organizational units and preparing the organizational project.

[ ^1 ]: A discipline is an object of mental space, but it can be described on a physical medium.
[ ^2 ]: Therefore, if you are developing a technology, it will most likely be used by a role based on a specific discipline as a tool. As the developer of this tool, you must be well-versed in the discipline with which the role will work using the tool.
