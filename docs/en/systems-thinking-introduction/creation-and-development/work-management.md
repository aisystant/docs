# Work Management

Work management differs from practice management. Practice management involves focusing on the methods (practices) by which all work artifacts will be created according to Table 3x3. One needs to understand which practices are necessary, implement them within the organization, and monitor their relevance. In turn, work management is based on established practice management.

Work management (also known as operation management or operational activities management) involves allocating resources to implement plans on time and within budget. Here, work stages emerge, which, as you know, differ from logical phases where practices follow one another^[For example, first comes wall cleaning and plastering, followed by painting, not the other way around.]. However, detailed planning for all stages is rarely used today, as life quickly brings adjustments. Only the upcoming stage is planned in detail, while all subsequent stages are considered with broad assumptions, as the situation is likely to change significantly when work on these stages begins.

Practice management is an engineering discipline, requiring a solid understanding of engineering work practices. In contrast, work management is purely a managerial discipline, necessitating a strong knowledge of operational management.

Work management abstracts from the engineering essence of operations, such as system modeling, whose results are generally presented in Table 3x3. All work within project activities or at the enterprise level is inevitably linked to areas of interest.

Knowledge of how to perform tasks is not particularly needed by the operational manager. The manager's goal is to achieve the fastest and cheapest task completion to obtain the work artifact from the system modeling. This is achieved using managerial methods. For instance, if the productivity of an assembly line is insufficient, the manager may decide to add more machines. It doesn't matter to them what kind of processing the machine performs or whether it can be done using other methods and tools. They resolve the bottleneck through a managerial approach. On the other hand, finding another practice to solve the same productivity problem falls under practice management or organizational development projects, which are handled by the Chief Transformation Officer^[Any problem can be addressed with engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For example, one can change the way work is done, add resources and executors, or choose not to solve this problem and focus on another.] .

Work management encompasses various practices such as project management, process management, and case management. Each practice is characterized by its set of interests and the corresponding method of describing the work flow. However, they all share a common goal: to speed up the work flow while minimizing its cost.

Project management involves upfront planning, which includes checkpoints, resources, start and end times, productivity standards, etc. For example, project management is effectively used in building construction when a design bureau has prepared the project documentation. Builders simply need to carry out the necessary work according to specific stages.

Process management involves uniform tasks, a standard sequence of steps, typically determined not so much by a plan as by regulations. Process management can be used at the operation stage of the same building. Processes such as cleaning, garbage removal, scheduled maintenance, etc., are clearly visible here.

Case management is a more modern way of managing work. A case is a situation, circumstance, or initiative that requires a set of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject of interest over which actions are performed. Examples include a person, a legal case, or an insurance claim. A case depends on the emerging circumstances, as it is impossible to calculate all tasks in advance. Case management is convenient to apply during the life cycle stages of conception and design because it is difficult to plan, but it is still necessary to manage the work. The case concept is very helpful here.
