# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summaries)

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. Notice that similar text descriptions have already appeared in textbooks. The table provides a brief description compiled at the start of a project, which is then used for detailing in other descriptions as well as to ensure all team members share the same understanding. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

If necessary, make notes for further revision. You might not immediately create a good description, and it may require return visits and improvements.

Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its items.
