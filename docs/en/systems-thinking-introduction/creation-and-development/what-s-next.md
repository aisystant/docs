# What's Next?

You have completed all sections of the course. I hope you have also finished all the homework assignments, including drafting templates and completing the modeling exercise.

Throughout the course, you began to master systems techniques and concepts. You have already tried applying some of them in your own projects. For now, your use of systems thinking is likely patchwork, and you are probably just starting to understand how to view collective activities. However, to truly accomplish something, you will need to take the “Systems Thinking” and “Methodology” courses, and make the most of systems thinking in your work activities.

As your next step, I recommend continuing your studies in the main “Organizational Development” program and, without fail, implementing a work project—gradually deepening your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to see you soon among the masters at Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website, on the “Qualifications” page^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>], you can explore the stages of life mastery.

Once you have grasped the basics of systems thinking, you can begin working with your environment. Regardless of your position, I recommend involving colleagues and team members in thoroughly developing specific work documents using systems thinking concepts.

To do this, you can—and should—start teaching your colleagues. First, collective systems thinking is much more productive than individual efforts. Second, the best way to learn something complex is to explain it to others. By explaining systems thinking to someone else, you deepen your own understanding. And third, it is exciting to become a leader of change, including initiating and carrying out the transformation of your team, your organization, and even the world as a whole.

Why not become the person who can drive systems changes within your organization? Set your sights on the role of Chief Transformation Officer or someone responsible for organizational changes, including the currently popular digital transformation. The ability to initiate, lead, and successfully implement change is exactly what AISYSTANT aims to teach. This is our recipe for a happy, successful, and fulfilling life.

I will be happy to answer your questions outside the course. Feel free to contact me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. And this is not goodbye. You have set out on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you will strive to stay on it—continuously and endlessly developing yourself and creating successful systems.
