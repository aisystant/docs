# What's Next?

You have completed all sections of the course. I hope you have also completed all the homework assignments, including drafting and modeling.

Throughout the course, you have begun to master systems techniques and concepts. You have already tried to apply something in your projects. Currently, this might be a patchwork application of systems thinking, and you are likely just starting to understand how to view collective activities. However, to accomplish something substantial, you will need to take the courses "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology," while maximizing the use of systems thinking in your work activities.

As a next step, I recommend continuing your education in the main program "Organizational Development," and make sure to implement a work project while gradually enhancing your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to soon see you among the masters at Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website, on the "Qualifications" page^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>], you can familiarize yourself with the steps of life mastery.

With a grasp of the basics of systems thinking, you can begin working with your environment. Regardless of your position, I recommend engaging colleagues and employees to thoroughly work through individual position-specific documents using systems thinking concepts.

For this, it is not only possible but essential to start educating your colleagues. First, collective systems thinking is far more productive than individual efforts. Second, explaining complex topics to others is the best way to learn them. By explaining systems thinking to someone else, you improve your own understanding. Third, it's intriguing to become leaders of change, including initiating and facilitating the transformation of your team, enterprise, and the world in general.

Why not become the person who can conduct systems changes in your enterprise? Aim for a position like Chief Transformation Officer, or one responsible for organizational changes, including the currently trendy digital transformation. The ability to initiate changes, lead them, and carry them out successfully is what AISYSTANT aims to teach. This is our recipe for a happy, successful, and interesting life.

I am happy to answer your questions outside the course. Feel free to contact me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. And I’m not saying goodbye. You have embarked on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you strive to stay on it, continuously and endlessly developing and creating successful systems.
