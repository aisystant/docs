# What's Next?

You have completed all sections of the course. I hope you have also completed all assignments, including drafting plans and doing the modeling exercises.

Throughout the course, you began to grasp systems techniques and concepts. You've likely attempted to apply some of these in your projects. At present, this might be a patchwork application of systems thinking, and you're probably just starting to understand how to view collective activities. However, to truly accomplish something, you will need to undergo the "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology" courses, and maximally utilize systems thinking in your work activities.

As the next step, I recommend continuing your education with the primary "Organizational Development" program and definitely implementing a work project, progressively enhancing your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to soon see you among the masters at Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website, you can explore the steps of life mastery under the "Qualification" page [^1].

Having understood the basics of systems thinking, you can start engaging with your surroundings. Regardless of your position, I recommend involving colleagues and employees in thoroughly developing individual work documents using systems thinking concepts.

For this, it's advisable, and even necessary, to start teaching your colleagues. First, collective systems thinking is much more productive than individual efforts. Second, the best way to learn something complex is to explain it to others. By explaining systems thinking to someone else, you enhance your own understanding. And third, isn't it fascinating to become leaders of change, initiating and conducting the transformation of your team, company, and even the world?

Why not become the person who can implement systems changes at your company? Aim for the role of Chief Transformation Officer or someone responsible for organizational changes, including the increasingly popular digital transformation. The ability to initiate, lead, and successfully carry out changes is what AISYSTANT strives to teach. It’s our recipe for a happy, successful, and interesting life.

I’ll be glad to answer your questions after the course. Feel free to reach out to me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. I’m not saying goodbye. You've embarked on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you strive not to deviate from it, continuously and endlessly developing and creating successful systems.
