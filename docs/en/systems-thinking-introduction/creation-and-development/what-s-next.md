You have completed all sections of the course. I hope you've also completed all the assignments, including drafting templates and modeling.

Throughout the course, you've begun to grasp systems techniques and concepts, attempting to apply them in your projects. At present, this is a patchwork application of systems thinking, and you are likely just starting to see how to view collective activities. To fully achieve this, you'll need to take the courses "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology" and maximize the use of systems thinking in your work activities.

As the next step, I recommend continuing your education in the main "Organizational Development" program and implementing a work project to progressively deepen your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to soon see you among the masters at Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website's "Qualifications" page, you can explore the steps to mastery of life skills.

Having understood the basics of systems thinking, you can begin working with your surroundings. Regardless of your position, I recommend involving colleagues and employees in a detailed examination of specific work documents using systems thinking concepts.

To achieve this, it's not only possible but necessary to start educating your colleagues. First, collective systems thinking is much more productive than individual thinking. Second, the best way to learn something complex is by explaining it to others. By explaining systems thinking to someone, you improve your understanding. And third, it's exciting to become a leader of change, initiating and conducting transformations of teams, enterprise, and the world.

Why not be the person who can implement systems changes in a company? Aim for the role of Chief Transformation Officer or whoever is responsible for organizational changes, including the current trend of digital transformation. The ability to initiate, lead, and successfully implement changes is what AISYSTANT aims to teach. It's our recipe for a happy, successful, and interesting life.

I will be glad to answer your questions beyond the course. Feel free to contact me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. And I won’t say farewell. You have embarked on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you strive to stay on it, continuously and infinitely developing and creating successful systems.
