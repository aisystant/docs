# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.3. The Executor's Qualifications

Reflect on your last three conversations with colleagues and fill out the table. Evaluate qualifications on a ten-point scale, where 0 means "completely lacks knowledge of the method, cannot do anything," and 10 means "masters the method better than anyone else in the world, can perform every task within this method with consistently excellent results."

Create notes for further development as needed.

Locate the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
