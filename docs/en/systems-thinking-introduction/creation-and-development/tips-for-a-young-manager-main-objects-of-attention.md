# Tips for a Young Manager: Key Areas of Focus

Stepping into a managerial role is always a challenge, especially if you are new to managing people. You might be an excellent specialist—a marketer, an engineer, or a doctor. However, the role of a manager involves not just knowledge of the subject area but, more importantly, knowledge of management. Ideally, this should be systems management [ ^1 ].

The methodology of systems management is universal, no matter what you are managing: a small team of three people, a large manufacturing operation, or a multinational company. It is much easier to understand the ideas of systems management in a small division and then apply them as growth occurs.

For young managers just starting their journey in team management, it's important to grasp two key areas of work:

* operational activities;
* organizational development.

Of course, it's also crucial to understand the product (system of interest) that the company produces, but this you likely already comprehend well.

Operational activities are your foundation as the person responsible for ongoing work. The work of your department should be as finely tuned as clockwork. It's vital that the products are delivered on time, with the required quality, and within budget. For example, imagine a production line where each employee knows their role and performs it impeccably, ensuring seamless operation.

Organizational development comes into play when it involves developing and modernizing your "production line." This may include implementing new work methods, using new tools, or altering the team’s structure to enhance efficiency. For instance, consider an IT company that decides to transition to a new work method, like the Agile methodology to speed up product development. A manager must not only motivate the team to embrace new methods but also exemplify adaptability and readiness for change.

As a leader, you need to motivate employees to work effectively in both areas and set an example yourself by demonstrating high efficiency and openness to innovation. Your task is to create a team that is ready and able to perform in both operational activities and organizational development. Typically, employees have a good understanding of operational activities and are less inclined towards organizational changes in the system they work on.

It's also crucial to engage not only with your team but with your surroundings. Your efforts to implement change may affect not only your department but the entire organization. Therefore, it's essential to secure the support of your superiors and related departments. For example, if you manage a marketing department and see the need for improved customer processes, this may require collaboration with product development, sales, and the IT department to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don’t manage your boss, they will manage you by transmitting their agenda and ideas. Not all of these will be systems-oriented if your boss hasn't studied systems methodology like you have. This means you should actively participate in shaping your agenda by suggesting your ideas and showing initiative. Your goal should be to turn your boss into an ally and like-minded partner in implementing necessary changes.

In conclusion, remember that success in a managerial role depends on your ability to manage current operations as well as your vision and competence in implementing systems changes. Be a leader who is not afraid of challenges and is ready for continuous development, both personal and that of your team.
