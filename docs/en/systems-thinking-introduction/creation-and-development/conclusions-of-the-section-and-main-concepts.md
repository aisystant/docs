# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

The creation and development of systems are examined in relation to various systems. In any project activity, numerous systems are created and developed at different system levels and creation chains. At a minimum, the creation and development of the system of interest and the creation systems occur.

Systems thinking identifies important objects of focus for any activity. We start with the area of interest of the supersystem, meaning we look at the world we want to change in some way. We then move on to the system of interest and its structure. Further, we discuss the system-creator, including creation methods, roles, and resources.

Techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system through concepts such as organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and others.

Systems thinking can be considered as one way to obtain work artifacts. Techniques of systems thinking allow for the acquisition of necessary work artifacts based on system modeling, which is described in the 3x3 Table. It's a kind of checklist that ensures nothing is forgotten during the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

Key concepts: practice, method, organizational role, work artifact, discipline, tool, work management, method management, methods manager, enterprise architect, stages, phases, organization, organizational unit, service, principle of continuity, iteration, increment, functional description of the enterprise system, modular description of the enterprise system.
