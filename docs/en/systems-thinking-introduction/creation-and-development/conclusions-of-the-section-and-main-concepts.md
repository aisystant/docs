Creating and developing systems is viewed in relation to different systems. In any project activity, multiple systems are created and developed across various system levels and creation chains. At a minimum, this involves the creation and development of the system of interest and creation systems.

Using a systems approach defines important objects of focus for any activity. We begin with the interests of the supersystem, looking at the world we intend to change in some way. Next, we move to the system of interest and its structure. Finally, we discuss the system-creator, including methods of creation, roles, and resources.

The techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system through notions like organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and others.

Using a systems approach can be viewed as a means of accomplishing work. Systems approach techniques enable us to accomplish necessary work based on system modeling, as described in the Table 3x3. This serves as a checklist to ensure nothing is overlooked in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.
