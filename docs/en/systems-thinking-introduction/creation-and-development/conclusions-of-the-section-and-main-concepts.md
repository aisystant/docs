# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

The creation and development of systems are examined in relation to different systems. In any project activity, numerous systems are created and developed across various system levels and creation chains. At a minimum, there is the creation and development of the system of interest and the creation systems.

Systems thinking defines important objects of focus for any activity. We start with the areas of interest of the supersystem, meaning we look at the world we wish to change in some way. Then, we move to the system of interest and its structure. After that, we discuss the system-creator, including the methods of creation, roles, and resources.

The techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system through concepts such as organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and others.

Systems thinking can be considered a way to obtain work. The methods of systems thinking enable acquiring necessary tasks based on system modeling, as described in the 3x3 Table. It's a kind of checklist to ensure nothing is forgotten in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

Key concepts: practice, method, organizational role, work artifact, discipline, tool, work management, method management, method manager, enterprise architect, stages, phases, organization, organizational unit, service, principle of continuity, iteration, increment, functional description of the enterprise system, modular description of the enterprise system.
