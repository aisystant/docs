# Complete the modeling exercise: 7.15. My Qualification at AISYSTANT

Review the example in the first row of the table. In the "Life Mastery" column, evaluate your current life mastery on a 10-point scale. Life mastery is calculated as the average of thinking mastery and applied mastery. The assessment of thinking mastery is calculated as the average in the table "Level of Thinking Mastery," while the applied mastery score is the average in the table "My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects."

Indicate your current qualification at AISYSTANT and the year you attained it. Also, note the years you attained previous qualifications to assess your progress. In the column “What needs to be done to achieve the next qualification,” describe your self-development plans.

Note that unused knowledge fades, so it's important to regularly reaffirm your qualifications. It's not required to do this within AISYSTANT, but we would be glad if you share the results of your professional and personal projects on AISYSTANT's public platforms. This will suffice for updating and awarding a new qualification.

The highest qualification, "constructor," implies that you can discover new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that change the world for the better, and lead a happy, successful, and interesting life.

Find the corresponding assignment by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
