# Work and Task

**Work** is a specific activity or behavior of an organizational unit carried out at a certain physical time. As a result of the work, a work artifact appears in the physical world. It can also be described as a process involving the organizational unit alongside resources. Within this process, the organizational unit performs a service using certain resources.

For example, John, with a hammer, drives nails during the allocated time and receives payment for it. John, in the role of a carpenter with a hammer, constitutes the organizational unit. The service is driving nails.

When discussing work, the main interest lies not so much in its content^[i.e., which methods (tools) are needed to accomplish the work.], but in how to gather the necessary resources for this work and which organizational unit should perform these tasks to produce the needed work artifact.

Managers often act as planners who, based on planning methods, distribute tasks to performers. Their concern is about which performer should create a specific work artifact, in what timeframe, and with what resources.

Each cell of the 3x3 Table can be viewed as a set of tasks that need to be completed^[Each cell of the 3x3 Table has its planner.]. The description in the subsection "How Systems Thinking Helps in Work Activities," about the essence of systems thinking, can be seen as high-level or typical tasks that need to be accomplished in any project. For instance, it is necessary to develop a usage concept or secure investments.

Tasks emerge from systems modeling, and to ensure they are completed, they need to be expressed as work. A task contains an action that must be performed within the project framework. Ideally, it should mention the method. A task becomes work when the following are known:

1. Who or which performer (Full Name);
2. By what deadline;
3. In what role;
4. By what method (practice);
5. With what resources;
6. What work artifact will result.

To accurately formulate work, the planner must have accessible information on the availability of resources (time, funds, and components) and the skills of the performers.

The enterprise architect must delineate the organizational units (subdivisions) in such a way that each can function as maximally autonomous teams. Otherwise, it will be impossible to coordinate all the work, which includes tasks for each cell of the 3x3 Table, as well as considers the incremental development of the system of interest. Additionally, note that the project might involve developing numerous "our systems" for various teams, further complicating work management. You will learn more about this in the third semester of the main program at Aisystant.
