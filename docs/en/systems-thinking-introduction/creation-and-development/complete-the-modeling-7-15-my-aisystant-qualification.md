# Perform the Modeling: 7.15. My AISYSTANT Qualification

Review the example in the first row of the table. In the "Life Mastery" column, evaluate your current life mastery on a scale of 1 to 10. Life mastery is calculated as the average of the sum of thinking mastery and applied mastery. The assessment of thinking mastery is determined as the average in the "Level of Thinking Mastery" table, and the assessment of applied mastery is calculated as the average in the "My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects" table.

Mark your current AISYSTANT qualification and the year it was obtained. Also, note the years of obtaining previous qualifications to evaluate your progress. In the column "What Needs to be Done to Obtain the Next Qualification," describe your self-development plans.

Please note that unused knowledge is forgotten, so it's important to regularly reaffirm your qualification. It's not necessary to do this within AISYSTANT, but we would appreciate it if you share the results of your work and personal projects on public AISYSTANT platforms. This will be sufficient for updating and awarding a new qualification.

The highest qualification, "constructor," implies that you can find new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that change the world for the better, and live a happy, successful, and interesting life yourself.
