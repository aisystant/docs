# Complete the Modeling: 7.15. My AISYSTANT Qualification

Review the example in the first row of the table. In the "Life Mastery" column, assess your current life mastery using a 10-point scale. Life mastery is calculated as the average of the sum of thinking mastery and applied skills. The thinking mastery score is calculated as the average in the "Level of Thinking Mastery" table, while the applied skills score is the average in the "My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects" table.

Record your current AISYSTANT qualification and the year you obtained it. Additionally, note the years when you received previous qualifications to evaluate progress. In the "What Needs to Be Done to Obtain the Next Qualification" column, outline your self-development plans.

Remember, unused knowledge fades over time, so it's important to regularly maintain your qualification. Itâ€™s not necessary to do this within AISYSTANT, but we would be delighted if you shared the results of your work and personal projects on AISYSTANT's public platforms. This will suffice to refresh and assign a new qualification.

The highest qualification, "constructor," implies that you can find new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that make the world a better place, and lead a happy, successful, and interesting life.

Locate the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its tasks.
