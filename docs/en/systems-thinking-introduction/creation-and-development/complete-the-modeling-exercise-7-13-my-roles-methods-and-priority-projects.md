# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects

Fill in the empty rows with your main roles from both work and personal projects. Provide at least 10 roles. Try to cover all your work projects and all areas of your life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you perform well, the more likely you are to have an interesting life. At the end, calculate the average level of applied mastery. If needed, make notes for further reflection. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
