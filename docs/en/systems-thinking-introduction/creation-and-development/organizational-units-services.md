# Organizational Units and Services

Work is implemented by organizational units. An organizational unit consists of agents (people, organizations, AI) along with materials and equipment available to them. The minimum organizational unit is a single employee hired for a specific position and managing the relevant resources.

Organizational units usually do not initiate work on their own. In collective activities, some organizational units have the authority to assign work to others, who, in turn, have the duty to carry out such requests. The entire set of organizational units with mutual authorities constitutes an organization. A system of interest may be created by an extended enterprise, which can include multiple organizations. Thus, legal or organizational-legal separation is one possible description of a system-creator.

Each organizational unit performs external activities that we refer to as services. For example, within a company, there is an organizational unit responsible for calculating salaries, and another one that disburses them, thereby providing the services of salary computation and disbursement. Additionally, there are assembly services, such as those for assembling an automotive vehicle. Organizational units may provide services either to other organizational units or to the system of interest [^1].

Work occurs when an organizational unit receives an assignment and the necessary resources. The organizational unit then delivers the required service, resulting in a work artifact. Until an assignment or resources are provided, the service is not delivered, and the work is not carried out.
