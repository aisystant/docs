# Complete the modeling exercise: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects

Fill in the empty rows with your main roles from both work and personal projects. Provide examples of at least 10 roles. Try to cover all your work projects and all areas of life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you carry out effectively, the more likely you are to have an interesting life. In the end, calculate the average level of applied mastery. Create notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for a future draft.

Locate the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.
