# Stages and Phases

**Concepts of "Stage" and "Phase"**

The terms "stage" and "phase" pertain to time, but stages are linked to methods (practices) and logical time, whereas phases relate to tasks and physical time.

Methods (practices) can be arranged sequentially in logical time, with stages being identified if necessary. For instance, to create a system like a "painted wall," we can identify the following methods: filling, sanding, painting, drying.

Based on this, one can also define the functional parts of the organization that will paint the wall. In this functional consideration, we are not yet addressing when it will be done and by which agents (executors). These aspects will be discussed when we focus on tasks.

It is not always possible to immediately identify all necessary methods, and it is not always convenient to work with numerous practices, so they can be gathered into specific stages. For example, initially, one could outline a "cleaning" stage including practices like filling and sanding, as well as a "painting" stage, with practices such as painting, drying, and re-painting.

When creating many systems, common stages such as ideation, modeling, creation, and operation are often identified. However, within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices are defined for developing a specific system of interest. Consequently, substages may also be identified.

Practices within stages^[And the stages themselves are structured logically, as evident from the list of universal stages.] and substages are organized in a certain logical order, meaning creation typically follows modeling. However, different practices and stages might be carried out simultaneously, unlike phases that occur sequentially in physical time.

The list of practices and their logical order is determined by the system's concept and architecture. Each practice must have an assigned task, just as each system function is assigned to a module-structure. Each task is carried out by an organizational unit that plays a specific role for a particular practice at a certain time, using certain resources. Consequently, the organizational unit produces a work artifact.

Each phase comprises a specific list of tasks, and phases follow one after another in physical time. Tasks within a phase are executed by different organizational units, either sequentially or in parallel. Phases are determined by managers, who are keen to obtain specific work artifacts necessary to move on to other phases.

For example, a manager might designate a phaseâ€”system sales. The control point for this is a signed contract. However, during this phase, besides marketing practices, one can complete the stages of system ideation and design, or even system creation, at least for the first version or MVP. Conversely, it might be decided not to conduct any system creation work until a contract is signed. Therefore, which tasks are included in a specific phase is determined by managers.

The delineation of phases depends on task management methods, which will be covered in the next subsection. Work phases can be pre-planned or opened up as necessary. Tasks can be designated for all phases in advance, employing project management or process management methods. Alternatively, they can be defined as circumstances demand, thus employing case management.

Additionally, tasks may be organized such that methods that logically follow one another are executed concurrently. For example, one team preps the second wall while another simultaneously paints the already prepped first wall. This separation of methods and tasks, stages and phases, allows for convenient discussions about the activities of creation systems.
