# Stages and Phases

The concepts of "stage" and "phase" relate to time, but stages are connected with methods (practices) and logical time, whereas phases are associated with tasks and physical time.

Methods (practices) can be arranged sequentially in logical time, with stages being distinguished if necessary. For example, to create the "painted wall" system, we can identify the following methods: plastering, sanding, painting, drying.

From this perspective, we can also define the functional parts of the organization responsible for painting the wall. In such a functional consideration, we do not address when this will be done and by which agents (executors). We will discuss these aspects when we delve into the tasks.

It is not always possible to identify all necessary methods right away, and working with multiple practices can be cumbersome, so they can be grouped into specific stages. Initially, for instance, one might designate a "preparation" stage including plastering and sanding practices, and a "painting" stage including painting, drying, and repainting practices.

In creating many systems, one often delineates universal stages such as ideation, modeling, creation, and operation. However, within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices are identified for the creation of a specific system of interest. Consequently, substages may also be identified.

Practices in stages^[And the stages themselves are organized in a logical order, as seen from the list of universal stages.] and substages are arranged in a specific logical order—typically, creation follows modeling. However, different practices and stages may be implemented simultaneously, unlike phases, which occur strictly one after the other in physical time.

The list of practices and their logical order is determined by the system's concept and architecture. A task must be "assigned" to each practice, just as each system function is assigned a design module. Each task is carried out by an organizational unit that plays a specific role in a certain practice at a specific time and using a particular resource. As a result, the organizational unit produces a work artifact.

Each phase comprises a specific list of tasks, and phases follow each other strictly in physical time. Tasks within a phase are performed by different organizational units either sequentially or in parallel. Phases are determined by managers who need to obtain certain work artifacts, without which transitioning to other phases is impossible.

For example, a manager might define a phase as the sale of the system, with the contract conclusion as the milestone. However, during this phase, beyond marketing practices, ideation and system design stages can also be completed, and possibly even the creation of the system—or at least the first version of the system or MVP. Alternatively, it may be decided not to perform any system creation tasks until the contract is concluded. Therefore, the tasks included in a specific phase are determined by the managers.

The delineation of phases depends on the methods of task management, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Task phases can be planned in advance or initiated as necessary. Tasks can be assigned to all phases in advance, making it a method of project or process task management. Alternatively, they can be determined as circumstances arise, in which case it follows case management or case-based management.

Tasks may be organized so that methods that logically follow one another are executed simultaneously. For instance, one team may prepare a second wall, while another team simultaneously paints an already prepared first wall. Such separation of methods and tasks, stages and phases, facilitates a convenient discussion about the activities of creation systems.
