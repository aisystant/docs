# Stages and Phases

The concepts of "stage" and "phase" relate to time, but stages are connected with methods (practices) and logical time, whereas phases are linked with tasks and physical time.

Methods (practices) can be arranged sequentially in logical time, and if necessary, they can form stages. For example, to create the system "painted wall," we can identify the following methods: puttying, sanding, painting, and drying.

Based on this, incidentally, we can define the functional parts of an organization that will paint the wall. In this functional consideration, we do not yet discuss when this will be done and by which agents (executors). This will be discussed when focusing on tasks.

It is not always possible to immediately identify all necessary methods, and it is not always convenient to work with a multitude of practices, so they can be grouped into specific stages. Initially, for example, the stage "cleaning" might include practices such as puttying and sanding, while the stage "painting" includes practices like painting, drying, and repainting.

In the creation of many systems, universal stages such as ideation, modeling, creation, and operation are often highlighted. Within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices for creating a specific system of interest are determined. Consequently, sub-stages may also be identified.

Practices in stages [ ^1 ] and sub-stages are arranged in a certain logical order; for instance, creation typically follows modeling. However, different practices and stages can be implemented simultaneously, unlike phases, which occur strictly one after another in physical time.

The list of practices and their logical order is defined by the concept and architecture of the system. Each practice should be "assigned" a task, just as each system function is assigned a design-module. Each task is carried out by an organizational unit, which plays a specific role within a practice at a certain time and with the use of some resource. As a result, the organizational unit obtains a work artifact.

Each phase contains a specific list of tasks, and phases follow one another in physical time. Tasks within a phase are performed by different organizational units either sequentially or in parallel. Phases are determined by managers who aim to achieve specific work artifacts necessary to transition to subsequent phases.

For example, a manager may define a phase as the sale of the system. For them, the checkpoint is the signed contract. However, during this phase, beyond marketing practices, the stages of ideation and system design, or possibly even system creation, can be completedâ€”at least the first version of the system or MVP. Alternatively, it might be decided to avoid any creation tasks until the contract is signed. Therefore, the tasks included in a specific phase are determined by the managers.

The determination of phases depends on the methods of task management, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Task phases can be pre-planned or opened as needed. Tasks can be assigned to all phases in advance. In this case, it would be methods of project or process task management. Or, they can be determined as circumstances arise, in which case it would be case management.

Meanwhile, tasks can be organized in such a way that methods logically following one another can be executed simultaneously. For example, one team cleans the second wall while another team simultaneously paints the already cleaned first wall. Such a division of methods and tasks, stages and phases, allows for a convenient way to discuss the activity of creation systems.
