# How Systems Thinking Helps in Work Activities

In previous sections, we explored the foundational ideas and techniques of using a systems approach. Now, let's provide a comprehensive explanation of how to view any collective activity through the lens of systems thinking. This involves breaking the world down into distinct parts and connecting them to ultimately create a successful system of interest without losing sight of the system-creator. This insight will assist not only in working within a team that is developing a system of interest or "our system," but also in interacting[^1] with other teams that are producing supersystems, surrounding systems, subsystems, or creation systems.

We'll start with a brief overview of what you've already studied about using a systems approach. Pay special attention to the second part of the description, which discusses the system-creator. It's a continuation of the essence of using a systems approach, introduced in the subsection "Systematicity and The Use of a Systems Approach" in Section 1, and further clarified in the subsection "Areas of Interest" in Section 5.

It's now time to provide a more comprehensive description, incorporating all the systems concepts learned. The logical progression of thought remains unchanged. We begin with the supersystem's area of interest—viewing the world we intend to change. We then move to the system of interest and its structure, and finally to the system-creator, including methods of creation, roles, and resources.

The constructor[^2] transforms the world for the better by creating a successful system that predictably solves specific problems (dissatisfactions) of a particular group of people (target audiences). These individuals, as the promoter assumes, will change their behavior, making it vital to understand their project roles and methods, including tools. The system's success hinges on addressing the interests of external project roles[^3], for which it is necessary to assume the function of the working system (the role of the system of interest) in its environment and consider the subjects of interest for the project roles.

To this end, a product owner[^4] creates a usage concept for the system as a "black box." This aids developers in formulating the system concept, which outlines interactions between the functional parts of the system[^5] and proposes its design. It is also aligned with spatial layout and an assessment of the system's total cost of ownership[^6]. These concepts are also used by the visionary in making decisions about the commercial viability of bringing the system of interest to market.

Alongside developers, architects are interested in the system as a "transparent box," who, based on subjects of interest[^7], determine the principles for dividing the system into modules and organizing connections between them. Such architectural decisions, known as system architecture, are the result of assessing numerous conflicts between system levels[^8].

Guided by the principle of universal continuity[^9], architects strive to organize autonomous creation system teams to release system increments for the most independently related modules. The overall team endeavors to detail all systems[^10] descriptions sufficiently for manufacturing the system of interest on the chosen production platform—and to produce[^11] it according to the techniques proposed by technologists and DevOps. Subsequently, the system is operated, continuously reiterating improvements to some parts, or even a complete change, or modifications to subsystems, or the release of additional systems of interest.

For all this, an effective system-creator (often an organization or enterprise) is essential. Entrepreneurs attract investor resources for the development and current activities of the production platform (until profitability is achieved), focusing on the success of the entire enterprise.

Thinking about the system-creator is structured similarly—its functional parts are project roles (organizational roles) executing diverse tasks by methods[^12], and its constructive parts are organizational units. Employees in various project roles perform tasks as if on a production assembly line (with other agents, including other enterprises, AI, equipment). This operational activity is directed by the operations manager[^13]. The Chief Transformation Officer[^14] initiates or organizes the conveyor for the development system to restructure the current production platform during the creation and/or continuous development of the system of interest.

Systems thinking for physical world alteration recurs across many levels and across various systems. In your project work or enterprise, you might be involved in creating and developing not only the system of interest (with its subsystems) but also the system-creator. Moreover, it predominantly involves an endless process of development, for which we need systems concepts and specific thinking techniques.

Perhaps the presented description[^15] of applying systems thinking is not entirely clear to you now—yet the full picture will gradually form as you progress through the main AISYSTANT program. You've likely grasped the first part of this text well, but the second part about the system-creator might have been less clear. We will delve into clarifying this second part in this section.

[^1]: Sometimes this also involves reconciling among various team members, not just coming to an agreement oneself.
[^2]: In entrepreneurial roles, they aim to change the world, which may simultaneously involve earning money. Awareness of both is crucial, as financial aspects are often not overlooked, whereas the physical transformation of the world might not be as well considered.
[^3]: These roles are played by people from a particular group (the target audience).
[^4]: Also known as a product manager (as a position), though in Russian culture, they often refer to it as systems analysts.
[^5]: This is a decomposition from the working system's function.
[^6]: Total cost of ownership considers the system’s operational lifetime, described in the usage concept, as well as its creation time—essentially cost-description of the system as a "transparent box."
[^7]: These are the "–ilities," such as the system's architectural characteristics (subjects of interest) like availability, continuity, efficiency, recoverability, reliability and security, resilience, scalability, configurability, extendability, installability, reusability, localization, maintainability, portability, supportability, and upgradability. Additionally, architects employ four key metrics of "continuity in everything": deployment frequency; change lead time; change failure rate; recovery time.
[^8]: Architects are compelled to make the less bad decisions since there are no good ones—according to systems approach 3.0, hoping for stability is not wise, as misalignments are everywhere. Thus, problems inevitably emerge from both higher and lower system levels.
[^9]: More details on continuous iteration will be addressed in the subsection "Increment and Iteration."
[^10]: Remember that multiple systems are described in the project, not just the target system. Some teams also need to create subsystems, and others even creation systems.
[^11]: Preferably create an MVP rather than striving for a perfect system immediately.
[^12]: This includes methods for describing various systems, including the system-creator. It needs a description as well.
[^13]: The operations manager is an instance of the "managers" class. Within this class, we further distinguish a public relations or government relations manager, who monitors the satisfaction of external project roles interested in the enterprise's activities, such as tax authorities, environmentalists, or public representatives. We also identify an administrator in charge of the administrative conveyor, overseeing departments like accounting, HR, etc.
[^14]: This could be a separate role or a person simultaneously serving as a CIO and a Chief Transformation Officer.
[^15]: It’s a sort of lens for conveniently viewing any activity.
