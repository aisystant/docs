# How Systems Thinking Aids in Work Activities

In previous sections, we explored the main ideas and techniques of the systems approach. Now, we'll provide a general explanation of how to view any collective activity from the perspective of systems thinking. This means how to divide the world into separate parts and how to connect them in order to ultimately create a successful system of interest without losing sight of the system-creator. This will help you not only work within a team that creates the system of interest or "our system" but also interact [ ^1 ] with other teams that create supersystems or surrounding systems, subsystems, or creation systems.

Let's start with a brief description of what you have already learned in previous sections about the systems approach. Pay special attention to the second part of the following description, where we'll discuss the system-creator. This continues the description of the essence of the systems approach, the beginning of which was offered in the subsection "The Use of a Systems Approach or Systems Thinking and Systematicity," Section 1, and was later refined in the subsection "Areas of Interest," Section 5.

Now it's time to provide a more complete description considering all studied systems concepts. The logical sequence of reasoning does not change in this process. We start with the area of interest of the supersystem, that is, we look at the world we want to change in some way. Then we move on to the system of interest and its design. After that, we discuss the system-creator, including creation methods, roles, and resources.

The constructor [ ^2 ] changes the world for the better by creating a successful system that predictably solves certain problems (dissatisfactions) for a group of people (target audiences). These people, as the promoter assumes, will change their behavior, making it important to understand their project roles and methods, including tools. The success of the system depends on satisfying the interests of external project roles [ ^3 ], which requires hypothesizing the function of the working system (role of the system of interest) in its environment and taking into account the subjects of interest to the project roles.

For this, the product owner [ ^4 ] creates the usage concept of the system as a "black box." This helps developers create a system concept, in which the interaction of the system's functional parts [ ^5 ] is described and its design is proposed. This design is also linked to spatial configuration and to the assessment of the total cost of ownership of the system [ ^6 ]. These concepts are also used by visionaries to decide on the commercial viability of bringing the system of interest to market.

Alongside the developers, architects are interested in the system as a "transparent box," determining the principles of dividing the system into modules and organizing connections between them based on subjects of interest [ ^7 ]. The collection of such architectural solutions is called system architecture, which, according to the systems approach 3.0, results from assessing numerous conflicts between system levels [ ^8 ].

Guided by the principle of continuity [ ^9 ], the architect strives to organize autonomous creation system teams to release increments of the system for maximally independent modules. The entire team seeks to achieve a detailed description of all systems [ ^10 ], sufficient for the manufacturing of the system of interest on the chosen production platform, — and to manufacture [ ^11 ] it using methods proposed by technologists and DevOps. Subsequently, the system is operated, repeatedly improving certain parts [ ^12 ], or even entirely changing it, or altering subsystems, or releasing other target systems.

For all of this, an efficient system-creator (often an organization or enterprise) is necessary. For the development and ongoing operation of the production platform (until profitability), entrepreneurs seek resources from investors, focusing on the success of the entire enterprise.

Thinking about the system-creator is arranged similarly — its functional parts are project roles (organizational roles) that perform various tasks according to methods [ ^13 ], and its structural parts are organizational units. Employees in different project roles perform tasks according to certain methods (practices), as if on a production line (with other agents, including other enterprises, AI, and equipment). This production activity is managed by an operations manager [ ^14 ]. And the creation or organization of the conveyor is initiated by the Chief Transformation Officer [ ^15 ]. They can also initiate the development of the system-creator to restructure the current production platform during the creation and/or continuous development of the system of interest.

Systems thinking for physical world changes occurs recursively at many levels and for various systems. In your project activities or enterprise, this might involve not only the creation and development of the system of interest (with its subsystems) but also the creation and development of the system-creator. It often involves an endless development process, for the systemic organization of which systems concepts and certain thinking skills are necessary.

The presented description [ ^16 ] of using systems thinking may not be entirely clear to you, but a complete picture will emerge over the course of the AISYSTANT main program. You likely understood the first part of this text well, whereas the second part concerning the system-creator may not be as clear. We will delve into this second part further in this section.

[ ^1 ]: Sometimes this involves aligning all team members from different teams with each other, not just personally agreeing with them.

[ ^2 ]: In entrepreneurial roles, they aim to change the world and may simultaneously aim to earn money. It's better to be aware of both, as often money is not forgotten, but physical world changes are not particularly considered.

[ ^3 ]: Which will be played by people from a certain group (target audience).

[ ^4 ]: Or product manager (as a position), although in Russian culture, systems analysts are discussed.

[ ^5 ]: Decomposition by the function of the working system.

[ ^6 ]: Total cost of ownership considers the system's operation time described in the usage concept, as well as the system's creation time, meaning the cost description of the system as a "transparent box."

[ ^7 ]: So-called “–ilities/-ities,” which are architectural characteristics of the system (subjects of interest) such as availability, continuity, performance, recoverability, reliability and safety, resilience, scalability, configurability, extensibility, installability, reusability, localization, supportability, portability, maintainability, upgradability. Additionally, architects use four key "continuity of everything" metrics: deployment frequency; lead time for changes; change failure rate; mean time to recovery.

[ ^8 ]: Architects are forced to choose the least bad decisions, as there will be no good decisions, since according to the systems approach 3.0, one cannot dream of stability; instead, there are pervasive misalignments. Therefore, from a higher or lower system level some problem will certainly arise.

[ ^9 ]: More about the principle of continuity will be detailed in the subsection "Increment and Iteration."

[ ^10 ]: Do not forget that the project describes several systems at once, not just the system of interest. Some teams will also need to manufacture subsystems, while others will manufacture creation systems.

[ ^11 ]: Preferably manufacture an MVP, rather than aiming for a perfect system immediately.

[ ^12 ]: Incremental development instead of iterative.

[ ^13 ]: Including methods for describing different systems, including the system-creator. It also needs to be described.

[ ^14 ]: The operations manager is an instance of the "manager" class. We also identify in this class a public relations or government relations manager, who monitors the satisfaction of external project roles interested in the enterprise's activities. For example, tax authorities, environmentalists, or public representatives. We also identify an administrator who is responsible for the administrative conveyor, such as the work of departments like accounting, HR, etc.

[ ^15 ]: This may be a separate role, or a person in the CIO position can simultaneously be the Chief Transformation Officer.

[ ^16 ]: That is, it is a kind of lens through which it is convenient to view any activity.
