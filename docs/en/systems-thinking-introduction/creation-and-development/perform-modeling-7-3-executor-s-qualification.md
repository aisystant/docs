# Perform Modeling: 7.3. Executor Qualification

Recall the last three conversations you had with colleagues and fill out the table. Evaluate the qualification on a ten-point scale, where 0 means "completely lacking the method, has no skills," and 10 means "masters the method better than anyone in the world, capable of executing this method with consistently excellent results."

If necessary, make notes for further analysis.

Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.
