title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.3. Executor''s Qualification'
---

Recall your last three conversations with colleagues and fill out the table. Evaluate the qualification on a ten-point scale, where 0 means "absolutely does not master the method, cannot do anything," and 10 means "masters the method better than anyone in the world, capable of achieving consistently excellent results with this method."

As needed, create notes for further analysis.

Locate the corresponding task by number in the workspace for modeling and complete all its points.
