# Organization as a System

An enterprise system, like any system, can be viewed as a "black box" and a "transparent box."

When we talk about the "black box," the organization can be seen analogously to a "person"—as an agent playing a certain role. However, we can certainly say that the role of a designer is played by John Doe or the project bureau JSC "Bridge Bureau." The "black box" focuses attention on external or role-based behavior.

The "transparent box" directs attention to the inner workings of this "box." Within an enterprise, there are people organized with tools and resources, and this enterprise provides certain services to someone. This means that it is not someone from outside requesting a function; rather, the enterprise itself offers a particular service externally, so "take it if you want, or leave it if you don't." This could be a project bureau offering a design service, an assembly shop providing assembly services, or a hair salon offering haircuts. Therefore, instead of the word enterprise (or organization), a more general term—"organizational unit"—can be used.

An organizational unit is not only an enterprise but also a department, an individual employee with their tools, or even a temporary team (workgroup). The organization itself also consists of organizational units, but this is just one perspective on the structure of an organization.

When considering the internal structure of an organization, we can approach it from the point of view of four main descriptions of the system as a "transparent box." We will not delve here into the comparatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions, but will focus on the crucial distinction between functional and modular breakdowns for the organization system.

Pay attention to the table presenting the main concepts and distinctions in the functional and modular approaches to analyzing an organization.
