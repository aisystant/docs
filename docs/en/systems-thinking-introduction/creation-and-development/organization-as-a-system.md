# Organization as a System

**A Business System: Black and Transparent Boxes**

A business system, like any system, can be viewed as a "black" box and a "transparent" box.

When discussing a "black box," the organization can be likened to a "person"â€”acting as an agent playing a specific role. For instance, we can say that the role of a designer is played by John Doe or the project bureau of OAO Mostproekt. The "black box" emphasizes external or role behavior.

The "transparent box" focuses on the internal workings of the "box." Within an enterprise, there are organized people equipped with tools and resources, providing services to others. Instead of external entities requesting a function, the enterprise itself offers a specific service, allowing others to either take it or leave it. This could be a project bureau offering design services, an assembly shop providing assembly, or a hair salon offering haircuts. Therefore, the term "organizational unit" could be a more general term than enterprise (or organization).

An organizational unit isn't solely a business enterprise; it can also be a department, an individual employee with their own tools, or even a temporary team (workgroup). The organization itself consists of various organizational units, but this is just one way to consider the structure of an organization.

When examining the internal workings of an organization, we can approach it through four primary descriptions of a system as a "transparent box." We will not delve into the relatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions; instead, we'll focus on the important distinction between functional and modular breakdowns for the organization system.
