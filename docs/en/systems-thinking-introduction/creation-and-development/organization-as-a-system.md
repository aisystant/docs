# Organization as a System

The enterprise system, like any system, can be viewed as both a "black box" and a "transparent box."

When we speak of a "black box," the organization can be likened to a "person"—acting as an agent that plays a specific role. However, we can certainly say that the role of the designer is played by John Doe or the project bureau JSC "Bridge Bureau." A "black box" draws attention to external or role-based behavior.

A "transparent box" directs attention to the internal structure of this "box." Within an enterprise, people are organized with tools and resources, providing services to others. This means that rather than someone externally requesting a function, the enterprise itself offers a specific service outward, so "take it if you want, or leave it if you don't." This could be a project bureau offering design services, an assembly shop offering assembly, or a hair salon offering haircuts. Therefore, instead of the word enterprise (or organization), we can use the more general term—“organizational unit.”

An organizational unit is not only an enterprise but also a division or an individual employee with their tools, or even a temporary team (working group). The organization itself is also composed of organizational units, but this is only one perspective of the organization's structure.

When approaching the internal structure of an organization, we can consider it from the perspective of four main descriptions of the system as a "transparent box." We will not delve into the comparatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions here but will focus on the important distinction between functional and modular breakdowns for the organization system.

Please refer to the table below, which presents the key concepts and differences in the functional and modular consideration of an organization.
