# Complete the modeling exercise: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery

Evaluate on a ten-point scale how much you learned thinking mastery at the university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you gained at Aisystant. The total should not exceed 10 points for each transdiscipline (for university, self-study, Aisystant).

It's all right if you don't fully understand the content of all the listed transdisciplines of the intellect stack: try to infer from the brief description provided in our course.

Indicate the year in which your knowledge would be considered SoTA (State of the Art) (for instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, that year can't be more recent than 1980).

Your assessment of your current thinking mastery can account for forgetting curves. If you excelled in a certain discipline in 2010 and would have given yourself 10 points back then, but haven't refreshed your mastery in the discipline since—how many points do you think still remain?

Ultimately, calculate the average level of your thinking mastery.

If necessary, make notes for further improvement. For instance, in the “Notes” column, you can record your reflections on what came to mind while completing the table. This approach will allow you to more consciously shape your personal educational trajectory.

Locate the corresponding assignment number in the workspace for modeling and complete all its sections.
