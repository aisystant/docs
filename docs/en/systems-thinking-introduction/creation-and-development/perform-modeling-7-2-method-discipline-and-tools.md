# Perform Modeling: 7.2. Method: Discipline and Tools

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Note that several methods are used in your activities, and each method can be implemented with different tools.

Provide examples from both professional and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks that you performed at work, spending more than two hours a day on them. What role did you play, which methods did you use, and where are these methods described? Also, mention the best alternative method (one that was considered but discarded when choosing how to execute a taskâ€”the best of the discarded options).

Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
