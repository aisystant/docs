# Perform Modeling: 7.2. Method: Discipline and Tools

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Note that multiple methods are used in your activities, and each method can be implemented using various tools.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks you have performed at work, on which you have spent more than two hours a day. In which role did you perform these tasks, what methods did you use, and where are these methods documented? Also, indicate the best among the alternative methods (considered but dismissed when choosing the way to execute the task â€” the best of the discarded options).

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
