# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.2. Method: Discipline and Tools

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the fact that multiple methods are used in your activities, and each method can be implemented using different tools.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks that you have conducted in your work, spending over two hours a day on them. In what role did you perform these tasks, what methods did you use, and where are these methods documented? Also, indicate the best of the alternative methods (those considered but discarded when choosing the method of executionâ€”the best among the discarded options).

Find the corresponding task by number in the workspace for modeling and complete all of its points.
