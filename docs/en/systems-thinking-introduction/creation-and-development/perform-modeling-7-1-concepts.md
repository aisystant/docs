**Write Down the Five or More Most Memorable Concepts from This Section, and Indicate the Concepts They Are Most Closely Connected With for You.** 

Other concepts may come from your current worldviews, so you don't need to mention only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with fellow students, colleagues, or friends. For example, try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.

**Find the Corresponding Task by Number in the Modeling Workspace and Complete All its Points.**
