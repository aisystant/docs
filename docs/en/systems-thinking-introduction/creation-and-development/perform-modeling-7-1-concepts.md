# Conduct Modeling: 7.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and note alongside them the concepts they are most strongly connected to. The other concepts may come from your current worldview, meaning you aren't required to list only this sectionâ€™s key concepts. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For instance, you could try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, link different concepts together, or explain their significance.

Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
