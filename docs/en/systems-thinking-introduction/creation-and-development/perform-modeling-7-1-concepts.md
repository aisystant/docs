# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.1. Concepts

List the five or more concepts from this section that stood out the most, and next to them indicate the concepts they are most strongly connected to in your mind. These additional concepts may come from your current worldviews, meaning you don't have to reference only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For example, you might try explaining these concepts in simple terms, providing examples from your own experience, linking different concepts together, or explaining their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in your modeling workspace and complete all the steps outlined.
