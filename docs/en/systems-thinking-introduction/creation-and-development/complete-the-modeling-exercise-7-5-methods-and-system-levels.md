# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.5. Methods and System Levels

Fill in the “Method” column based on the following description: “Andrew Smith will need to deliver many presentations with product demonstrations over the next six months. He is well-versed in the product he will be presenting, but he does not feel very confident when giving a public performance. He has broken down his presentation into system levels. Help him find a method for each system level so that he can select relevant training courses.”

As needed, create notes for further development. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
