# Perform Modeling: 7.4. Professional Communities Using Sota-Methods

Review the examples. Record the professional communities in which you participate (or have participated). Make notes for future development as needed. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down an idea for the future that comes to mind. By noting it immediately, you have a better chance to implement it later.

Find the corresponding task number in your modeling workspace and complete all its points.
