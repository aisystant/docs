# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

In this section, we discussed the cognitive technique of distinguishing between the embodiment, description, documentation, and function of a system. It can be said that any description pertains to a system. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The main relationships in systems are the "part-whole" relationships, also known as composition/assembly relationships. Divisions are made solely through attentionâ€”nothing in the physical world is deliberately divided into parts!

Every system has a function or role-related behavior that is necessary for certain external project roles. Systems are typically named according to their primary purpose or main function.

Complex systems are defined by the objects included within the given complex system. However, we do not refer to complex systems as processes, as they are different types of concepts.

**Main Concepts**: physical world, mental space; system description, system embodiment, system documentation; method of description; functional object=role object, role-related behavior=function=purpose in the surroundings (purpose of the system); physical object=role executor=module; naming of systems; "part-whole" relationship=composition/assembly relationship, system breakdowns, system levels; complex system, process.
