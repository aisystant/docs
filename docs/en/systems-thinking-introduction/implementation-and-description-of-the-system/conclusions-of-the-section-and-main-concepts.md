# Conclusions of the Section and Key Concepts

In this section, we discussed the mental technique of distinguishing between implementation, description, system documentation, and system function. It can be said that any description is a system description. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The primary relations in systems are "part-whole" relations, also known as composition/assembly relations. Breakdowns are done solely by attention; nothing in the physical world is specifically broken down into parts!

Every system has a function or role behavior that is necessary for some external design roles. Systems are usually named after their primary purpose or main function.

Complex systems are defined through the objects included in the given complex system. However, we do not refer to complex systems as processes; these are different types of concepts.

Key concepts: physical world, mental space; system description, system implementation, system documentation; description method; functional object=role object, role behavior=function=purpose in the environment (system's purpose); physical object=executor of the role=module; naming of systems; "part-whole" relation=composition/assembly relation, system breakdowns, system levels; complex system, process.
