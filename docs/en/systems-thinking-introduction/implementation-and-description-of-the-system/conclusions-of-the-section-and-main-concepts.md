# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

In this section, we discussed the cognitive technique of distinguishing between the embodiment, description, documentation, and function of a system. It can be said that any description is a description of a system. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The main relationships in systems are the "part-whole" relationships, also referred to as structure/assembly relationships. Breakdowns are done solely by attention; nothing in the physical world is explicitly broken down into parts!

Every system has a function or role-based behavior that is necessary for certain external design roles. Systems are usually named after their primary purpose or main function.

Complex systems are defined through the objects included in a given complex system. Meanwhile, we do not refer to complex systems as processes; these are different types of concepts.

Key concepts include: the physical world, mental space; system description, system embodiment, system documentation; method of description; functional object = role-based object, role-based behavior = function = purpose in the surroundings (system purpose); physical object = role executor = module; naming of systems; "part-whole" relationship = structure/assembly relationship, system breakdowns, system levels; complex system, process.
