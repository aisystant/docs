Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Provide at least two variations (as in the example). If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and names, use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Create notes for further review as needed. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in support chats or record a thought for future preparation.
