# Composition Relations

When we discuss embodiment, it's essential to consider the primary relations in systems, known as the "part-whole" relationship, also referred to as composition or assembly relations.

Engineers often refer to this as a breakdown of the system. The key in systems is the system breakdowns. The levels of this breakdown are the system levels. A system constructor is adept with a mental technique that allows them to deconstruct any subject area into system levels, based on various contexts (subjects of interest).

Decompositions are made with the attention of the person in the role or the team; nothing is physically broken down in the real world! If we have divided an elephant into a trunk, ears, legs, tail, etc., with our attention, it does not mean we have physically torn these parts from the body. We have highlighted these parts of the elephant with our attention for some reason^[For specific purposes, such as consuming the elephant in parts.]. Moreover, we have singled out the entire elephant as part of the physical world with our attention! Because we specifically needed the elephant. We can continue, highlighting a group of elephants, and then the savanna, where other animals live besides elephants. In this way, we have identified several system levels with our attention.

The main approach in breakdowns is from part to whole or from whole to part concerning the 4D dimension. In 3D, things are more or less clear: the wing and the fuselage are parts of an airplane, the fuel pump is part of the engine, which, in turn, is part of the airplane. If we accept that all systems exist not just in physical space but in space-time, then the entire discussion about different states of the system or its various roles becomes a discussion about parts over time. For example, an egg is simply part of a butterfly over timeâ€”while the butterfly is in the "egg" stage, there is no other "butterfly" in physical space taking the egg's place.

Thus, with the system's states or its roles, one can work with them as separate objects, and they can receive separate names. A butterfly at the "egg" stage is called an "egg." John Smith, while sick, is called a "patient." And here, "patient" is merely a role or state of John Smith.

Dividing a system into parts, especially when considering time, is a complex skill. It requires training. One has to start with understanding the composition relationship. Unfortunately, intuition often lets us down here. Systems thinking is counterintuitive, so sometimes the help of an instructor is needed. Additionally, it is important to practice solving educational tasks. We will identify system levels when studying Section 5, but in this section, try to highlight a subsystem, sub-subsystem, and supersystem within a system.
