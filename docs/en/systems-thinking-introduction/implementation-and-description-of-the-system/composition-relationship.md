title: Composition Relationship

When we talk about embodiment, it is essential to consider the primary relationships within systems, known as the "part-whole" relationships, also referred to as composition or assembly relationships.

Engineers often refer to this as a breakdown of the system. The key to systems is their breakdowns. The levels of this breakdown constitute the system levels. A system constructor has a well-developed cognitive approach by which they can divide any subject area into system levels, based on different contexts or subjects of interest.

These breakdowns are achieved through human attention in a role or by a team; nothing is physically dismantled in the real world! If we focus our attention to divide an elephant into its trunk, ears, legs, tail, etc., it doesn't mean we've physically detached these parts from the body. We highlight these parts in the elephant for certain purposes^[For specific goals, such as eating the elephant piece by piece]. Moreover, we focus on the entire elephant as part of the physical world because we specifically need the elephant. We can continue by identifying a group of elephants, and then the savannah, where various other animals reside. In this way, we distinguish several system levels with our attention.

The main approach in breakdowns is either from part to whole or from whole to part relative to the 4D measurement. In 3D, things are more or less clear: a wing and fuselage are parts of an airplane, and a fuel pump is part of an engine, which in turn is part of the airplane. If we accept that all systems exist not only in physical space but also in spacetime, then the discussion about different states of the system or its various roles becomes a discussion about parts over time. For example, an egg is merely a part of the butterfly over time; as long as the butterfly is at the "egg" stage, no other "butterfly" occupies the egg's place in the physical world.

Thus, system states or roles can be treated as separate objects, and they can receive individual names. A butterfly at the "egg" stage is called an "egg." John Smith, when sick, is referred to as a "patient," and "patient" here is simply a role or state of John Smith.

Dividing a system into parts, especially when it involves time, is a complex skill. It requires training. The process starts with understanding composition relationships. Unfortunately, intuition often fails us here. Systems thinking is counterintuitive, so sometimes the help of an instructor is needed. Additionally, it's important to practice solving educational problems. We will identify system levels in Section 5, but in this section, try to highlight the subsystem, sub-subsystem, and supersystem within a system.
