title: Word, Object, System

Let's master another thinking technique and learn to differentiate between "word," "object,"^[Here, we are referring to a physical object, not all objects which might include abstract ones.] and "system."

Let's take the word "hammer" as an example. In language, it's quite challenging to separate the word "hammer" from the physical object "hammer," meaning this specific hammer in my hand. In English, all these elements are tightly bound together for us. However, if a Chinese person were to say the word "hammer" in Chinese, we would hear only a collection of sounds and wouldn't associate it with the object "hammer." The word is simply sounds and signs (letters) assembled together. It is people who name some physical or abstract object with this word.

The word can refer to a physical object that is culturally identified by this word. Usually, before this "word" appears, there is some system, and the inventor gives it a name, or this name is later formed by the culture (as a class of certain physical objects). For example, a long time ago, the expression "automatic self-moving carriage" or "horse-less carriage" emerged, but later the word "automobile" became associated with this system. Overall, it's a cultural trend to find a short name for a system, even though initially, the inventor used a long phrase.

A good name for a system implies that its main function is understood from the name. Another example: an airplane or a system designed to enable flight. Often, names for systems, roles, and objects come from other languages. For example, the word "chauffeur" came from French and was linked to the function of "heater." Read more about this in the post "Chauffeur and Driver" on At Aisystant^[<https://systemsworld.club/t/shofer-i-voditel/8561>].

Subsequently, a system's name becomes linked to a specific object, or we use this invented word for certain objects. We must understand that the system "hammer" does not equate to the typical physical object "hammer" (the one in my hand), which everyone in the culture readily envisions. The word is the same, but the meaning is different, and in systems thinking, it's essential to keep this in mind.

In the first instance, we emphasize the need for a system that performs the function of driving nails. Incidentally, this system would likely be called a "nail driver" or simply an "object for driving nails." Then, the culture adopted the short system name - "hammer." But objects like "stone" or "microscope" could fulfill this role. Naturally, the best performer for this role is the typical physical object "hammer."^[This object was devised for this purpose and then named with this word. Now laypeople don't need to grasp what is being referred to specifically. However, a system constructor must be able to isolate words in context. By the way, there will always be good and bad performers vying for a specific work role, such as a manager.]

It's convenient to call a specific type of object that usually performs a certain function by one word. Culture usually manages this. This is why it's often hard to separate the word, physical object, and "hammer" system. But a system constructor must easily understand this from the context in any projects. The issue is that we get "hammer" easily, but when it comes to complex work projects, it might not be so straightforward. That's why we start by dissecting the example of the "hammer" and later apply the same thinking techniques in work projects.

Once you understand this differentiation, it will become easier to grasp what physical and functional objects are, what a system is, and other concepts of systems thinking.
