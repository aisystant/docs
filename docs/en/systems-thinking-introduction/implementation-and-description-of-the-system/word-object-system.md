# Word, Object, System

Let's master another thinking technique and learn to differentiate between "word," "object"[^1], and "system."

Let's take the word "hammer" as an example. In any language, it's quite challenging to separate the word "hammer" from the physical object "hammer," such as this specific hammer in my hand. In English, these concepts might be tightly connected in our minds. However, if, for example, a Chinese person were to say the word “hammer” in Chinese, we would hear just a combination of sounds and might not immediately think of the "hammer" object. So, a word is simply sounds and symbols (letters) put together. It is people who assign this word to a particular physical or abstract object.

A word can denote a physical object that is culturally recognized by that word. Typically, a "system" appears before a word, and the inventor assigns it a name, or the name evolves within the culture (as a class of certain physical objects). For example, at some point, there was the phrase "automatic self-propelled carriage" or "horse-free carriage," but eventually the term "automobile" became associated with this system. Overall, it is a cultural tendency to find a short name for a system, although initially, the inventor might have used a long phrase.

A good system name implies that its primary function is clear from the name. Another example is an airplane, or a system designed to enable flight on its own. Often, names for systems, roles, and items come from other languages. For instance, the word "chauffeur" came from the French language and was associated with the function of "heater." For more details, you can read the post "Chauffeur and Driver" in the AISYSTANT Club[^2].

Eventually, a system's name becomes linked with a specific object, or we use the coined word for certain objects. However, we must clearly understand that the "hammer" system does not equate to the typical physical object "hammer" (like the one in my hand), which everyone in the culture is familiar with. The word is the same, but the meaning differs, and systems thinking requires this awareness.

In the first case, we focus on the necessity of a system that performs the function of driving nails. Incidentally, this system would likely be called a "nail driver" or simply a "nail-driving tool." Later in culture, a short name for the system, "hammer," was established. But this role can be performed by physical objects like a "stone" or a "microscope." Naturally, the best performer for this role is the typical physical object "hammer"[^3].

Naming a specific type of object that usually performs a particular function with a single word is, of course, convenient. Culture usually manages this well. Therefore, we often find it challenging to separate the word, physical object, and the "hammer" system. However, a system constructor must easily discern this in context in any projects. It's because with a hammer, everything seems clear, but when it comes to complex work projects, it can be much trickier. That's why we start unraveling the concept with "hammer" and then apply the same thinking techniques in work projects.

Once you grasp this differentiation, you will find it easier to understand physical and functional objects, systems, and other concepts in systems thinking.

[^3]: This object was indeed invented for this purpose and subsequently named with this word. Now, laypersons do not need to understand the specifics in each case. However, a system constructor must master the skill of identifying words in context. Incidentally, for a specific work role, such as a manager, there will always be both good and bad performers vying for the position.
