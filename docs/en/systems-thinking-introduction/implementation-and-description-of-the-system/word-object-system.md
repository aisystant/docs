# Word, Object, System

Let's master another thinking technique and learn to differentiate between “word,” “object,” [ ^1 ] and “system.”

Take for example the word “hammer.” In language, it is quite difficult to separate the word “hammer” from the physical object “hammer,” meaning this specific hammer in my hand. In English, these are often strongly connected. However, if a Chinese person were to say the word “hammer” in Chinese, we would hear only a series of sounds and not even think about the object “hammer.” Thus, a word is simply sounds and signs (letters) arranged together. It is people who assign that word to a particular physical or abstract object.

A word can denote a physical object known by that term in the culture. Typically, before there is a "word," a system emerges, and the inventor gives it a name, or the culture later develops one (as a class of specific physical objects). For instance, once there was the phrase “automated self-moving carriage” or “horse-less carriage,” but eventually the word “automobile” stuck with that system. Overall, there's a cultural tendency to find a short name for a system, although the inventor might have initially used a lengthy phrase.

A good name for a system means its primary function is clear from the name. Another example: an airplane, or a system designed to enable flight. Often, the names of systems, roles, and objects come from other languages. For example, the word “chauffeur” originated from French and was related to the function of "stoker.” Read more about this in the post “Chauffeur and Driver” in the AISYSTANT club [ ^2 ].

Subsequently, the system’s name becomes associated with a specific object, or we use this invented word to label certain objects. However, we must clearly understand that the system “hammer” does not equate to the typical physical object “hammer” (like the one in my hand), which everyone in the culture is familiar with. The word is the same, but the meaning is different, and systems thinking requires this awareness.

In the first instance, we note that we need a system that performs the function of driving nails. Incidentally, this system would probably have been called a nail driver or simply a nail-driving tool. Then, the culture adopted the shorter name for the system—“hammer.” But this role could also be fulfilled by physical objects like “stone” or “microscope.” And of course, the best performer for this role is the typical physical object “hammer” [ ^3 ].

Naming a specific type of object that usually performs a particular function with a single word is certainly convenient. And culture typically handles this efficiently. That’s why it is often challenging to separate the word, physical object, and system “hammer.” Yet, a system constructor must easily grasp this from the context in any projects. It's simple with a hammer, but when it comes to complex work projects, it may become quite complicated. Therefore, we start by analyzing the example of the “hammer” and then apply the same thinking techniques to work projects.

Once you understand this separation, it will be easier for you to comprehend what physical and functional objects are, what a system is, and other systems concepts.

[ ^1 ]: Here, we discuss a physical object, not any object, among which there could be abstract ones.

[ ^3 ]: This item was actually invented for this purpose and named accordingly. So now laypeople don't need to understand what is being discussed in each particular case. However, a system constructor should possess the skill of identifying words in context. Incidentally, there will always be both good and bad performers vying for any specific work role, like that of a manager.
