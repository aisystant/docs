# System and Its Role-Based Behavior

Earlier, we explored the function of a system as the desired action or role-based behavior of the system. This desired action is assigned by people, meaning things (systems) do not choose their own functions. People need not so much the object itself (the material entity) as its function. Stakeholders value a system for its function, although a layperson often does not distinguish between them.

A system skill involves separately considering and discussing the function that someone needs and the design that best fits executing this function. More on this distinction will be covered in subsequent sections of the course.

The role-based behavior of a system is how it performs its functions and interacts with its surroundings, following a specific role. In systems thinking, the system is viewed as a "role object" that actively alters its environment while fulfilling its function.

Simply put, the system plays its role in a "play" or "game," where its actions and working methods are determined by its role. For example, if you're a customer at a pizzeria, you follow certain actions, such as ordering and paying for a pizza. If you start asking for sandals in the pizzeria, employees will step out of their usual roles and start figuring out what's happening because you've disrupted the role structure.

The core idea is that roles and methods of operation must be aligned: we first identify what needs to change in the surroundings of the system of interest, then choose how to achieve that change, and only then define the system's role, working methods, and the role of the system creators [ ^1 ]. This sequence helps to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings in projects.
