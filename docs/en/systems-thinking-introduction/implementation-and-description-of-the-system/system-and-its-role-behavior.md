# System and Its Role Behavior

We have previously explored the function of a system as a desired action or role behavior of that system. This desired action is assigned by people, meaning that things (systems) do not choose their own functions. People need not so much the thing itself (the material object), but rather its function. Stakeholders value a system for its function, although laypeople often fail to make this distinction.

A **system skill** is the distinct examination and discussion of a function that someone requires and the structure best suited for performing that function. Further details about this distinction will be discussed in subsequent sections of the course.

The role behavior of a system is the way in which it performs its functions and interacts with its surroundings, adhering to a specific role. In systems thinking, a system is considered a "role-based object" that actively alters its surroundings while performing its function.

In simpler terms, a system plays its role in a "play" or "game," where its actions and working methods are defined by its role. For example, if you are a customer at a pizzeria, you follow certain actions such as ordering a pizza and paying for it. If you begin asking for sandals at a pizzeria, the staff will step out of their usual role to figure out what is happening, because you have disrupted the role structure.

The main idea is that roles and working methods must be aligned: first, we determine what needs to be changed in the surroundings of the system of interest, then we choose how to make those changes, and only afterward do we define the system's role, working methods, and the role of the system-creators. This sequence helps avoid mistakes and misunderstandings in projects.
