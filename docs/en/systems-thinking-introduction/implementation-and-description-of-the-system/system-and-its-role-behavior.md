# System and Its Role Behavior

We have previously examined the function of a system as its desired action or role behavior. This action is assigned by people, meaning that things (systems) do not choose their functions themselves. People are interested not so much in the thing itself (a material object) as in its function. Stakeholders value a system for its function, although laypeople often do not differentiate them.

A system skill involves the distinct consideration and discussion of the function needed by someone and the structure that best suits executing this function. More details on this distinction will be discussed in later sections of the course.

Role behavior of a system refers to the way a system performs its functions and interacts with its environment in accordance with a defined role. In systems thinking, a system is viewed as a "role object" that actively changes its environment by performing its function.

Simply put, a system plays its role in a "play" or "game," where its actions and methods are determined by its role. For example, if you are a customer in a pizzeria, you follow certain actions such as ordering and paying for pizza. If you start asking for sandals in the pizzeria, the staff will step out of their usual role and begin to figure out what's going on because you disrupted the role structure.

The main idea is that roles and methods must be aligned: first, we determine what needs to change in the surroundings of the system of interest, then choose how to implement it, and only then do we define the system's role, the work methods, and the role of the system creators. This sequence helps to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings in projects. [ ^1 ]
