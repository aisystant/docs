Review the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material, paying attention to synonyms for the terms used in the table header. Fill in the blank cells in the rows following the example. Provide at least two options (as in the example). If your knowledge doesn't suffice to find the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. If needed, make notes for further exploration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in support chats or record a thought for a future draft.

Provide several examples from work and personal projects.
