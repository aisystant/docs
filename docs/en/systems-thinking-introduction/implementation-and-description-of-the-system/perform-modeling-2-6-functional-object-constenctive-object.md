# Table Translation Example

**Task**: Review the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material, paying attention to the synonyms of the terms used in the table header. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the example. Provide at least two variants (as in the example). If you lack the expertise to choose the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. If needed, create notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in support chats or record a thought for a future draft.

**Examples from Work and Personal Projects**: Provide several examples from professional and personal projects.

**Workspace Assignment**: Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
