# System Documentation

Let's delve deeper into system documentation. You're already aware that system documentation is a description of the system on some physical medium. This can include a parts catalog, a product brochure, a system model on a computer, or a text on paper. Notice that the words suggest [^1] the following: it lists physical world objects—brochure, model on a computer, paper. However, when discussing mediums, we haven't mentioned the content of the description. It can be seen, read, heard, etc., characterizing the system using different parameters [^2].

The concepts of "embodiment," "description," and "documentation" are necessary to avoid confusion when discussing the system. These concepts direct our attention and help discuss each aspect separately rather than lump everything together [^3]. Let's consider an example. The system could be a human as a biological being. A person is an object of the physical world and exists "in the flesh," meaning the "human" system is literally embodied in reality. It has numerous descriptions, like height, weight, hair color, skin color, etc. There is also a description in the form of a last name, first name, and middle name.

When we talk about descriptions, we understand that they do not exist in the physical world. By naming a person, we refer to a description of the person. It resides in the mental space. But there is also system documentation: a birth certificate, passport, international passport, driver's license, etc. These documents contain a specific description of the "human" system. These documents are presented in the physical world and contain a description [^4] that interests certain project roles. For example, the driver's license is of interest to a traffic inspector. If these interests did not exist, the description would not exist, and there would be no need to create such documentation.

A similar division into embodiment, description, and system documentation can be made for inanimate objects. Take a milkshake as an example. On one hand, this beverage in the physical world is the embodiment of the system. At the same time, the milkshake has different descriptions: name, recipe, etc. And there is system documentation on paper specifying the name and composition, as well as documentation in the form of a menu with a photo and price of the drink.

Descriptions refer to specific characteristics or properties of the system. This information doesn't exist in the real world. For example, you can't say a person's age “42 years” exists somewhere in the physical world with its length-width-height-time (4D dimension). You can point to a person, but that is the embodiment of the system. You can point to the number “42” in the physical world only if it is on a specific information carrier.

Thus, documentation can be presented as an IT-model, diagram, table, text on paper, or on a computer. So, when we say "documentation," we focus on the information carrier. It is prioritized in discussion until the words "embodiment" or "description" come up.

Descriptions can be informal or formal. Most people do not realize the importance of formal descriptions and suffice with informal ones. In complex projects, when dealing with numerous interests, formal descriptions are necessary: created by a specific method and placed on a medium. They help understand the subject of interest better because starting to create descriptions leads to a better understanding of the stakeholders. Informal descriptions often remain in people's minds and may not be backed by a formal description method. Much of what is just estimated in the mind gets forgotten.

As mentioned earlier, formal descriptions of subjects of interest are created by certain description methods (practices). A description method has a conceptual minimum and principles. This is covered in the course "Rational Work." Systems thinking relies on knowledge of ontologics (ontology and logic) so in the systems description, it is necessary to be able to read and create different models of systems and work with models understandable to a computer.

To create a successful system, certain role-based interests must be satisfied. This satisfaction happens through compiling models that respond to chosen subjects of interest to the system. That is why understanding system descriptions is so important. To embody a successful system in reality, it is necessary to work with system descriptions. These depend on the subjects of interest of project roles.

Most of you work with numerous system descriptions. During the modeling session, try compiling a table listing the documents you create or assist in creating, or documents made by your colleagues that you use in your work process. Match each document to the system it describes. Additionally, consider which systems are described in your company's development strategy or in other similar documents.

Despite modern office workers' reliance on descriptions, it's essential not to lose sight of the physical world. Always look for the system's embodiments. Systems thinking, first and foremost, is about the physical world, even though it deals with descriptions: "descriptions are nothing, but what they describe is everything!" All descriptions are made solely to change what is described in the physical world!

[^1]: Always pay attention to the words of your conversation partner. For example, how often do they use words from the physical world or mental space? Or what do they currently want to discuss: a substantive question, the format of content representation, or something else?

[^2]: What parameters? Those that interest numerous stakeholders.

[^3]: Our brain doesn't have enough computational power to discuss the system in several dimensions at once. Besides, these concepts may interest different roles.

[^4]: Substantive characteristic of the system.
