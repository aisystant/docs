# System Documentation

Let's delve deeper into the topic of documentation. You already know that **system documentation** is an explanation of the system recorded on some physical medium. This can include a parts catalog, a product brochure, a computer model of the system, or text on paper. Pay attention to the following: this list includes objects from the physical worldâ€”brochures, computer models, paper. However, when discussing media, we have not mentioned the content of the description itself. This content can be seen, read, heard, etc., and it characterizes the system according to various parameters.

The concepts of "embodiment," "description," and "documentation" are essential to avoid confusion when discussing a system. These concepts guide attention and allow each aspect to be discussed separately rather than conflated. Let's consider an example. A system can be a person as a biological entity. This person is an object of the physical world and is present "in the flesh," meaning the "person" system is literally embodied in reality. It has numerous descriptions, such as height, weight, hair and skin color, etc. There's also a description in the form of a last name, first name, and middle name.

When we talk about descriptions, we recognize that they are not present in the physical world. Referring to a person by name involves referencing the description of the person. It exists in the mental space. But there is also system documentation: a birth certificate, passport, international passport, driver's license, and so forth. These documents contain a specific description of the "person" system. Documents are present in the physical world and contain descriptions that are relevant to certain project roles. For example, a driver's license is relevant to a traffic officer. If these interests did not exist, there would be no need for the description and, consequently, no reason for this documentation.

A similar division into embodiment, description, and documentation of a system can be made for inanimate objects. Let's take a milkshake as an example. On one hand, this beverage in the physical world is the embodiment of the system. The milkshake has various descriptions: its name, recipe, etc. There is system documentation on paper that lists the name and ingredient composition, as well as menu documentation with a photo and price of the drink.

Descriptions refer to specific characteristics or properties of a system. This information does not exist in the real world. For instance, you can't say that a person's age, "42 years," exists somewhere in the physical world with its own length-width-height-time (4D dimensions). You can point to a person, which is the embodiment of the system. You can point to the number "42" in the physical world only if it is located on a specific information carrier.

Documentation can be represented as an IT model, a diagram, a table, text on paper, or in a computer. Hence, when we say "documentation," we focus on the information carrier. It remains a priority in the conversation until the words "embodiment" or "description" appear.

Descriptions can be informal or formal. Most people do not realize the importance of formal descriptions and are content with informal ones. In complex projects with numerous interests, formal descriptions, created by specific methods and recorded on a carrier, are necessary. They help navigate the subject of interest, because as you begin to draft descriptions, you better understand the stakeholders. Informal descriptions often remain in people's minds and may not be tied to a formal description method. Much of what is tentatively thought out in the head is forgotten.

As mentioned earlier, formal descriptions of subjects of interest are created using specific description methods (practices). Description methods include a conceptual minimum and principles, which are discussed in the course "Rational Work." Systems thinking relies on the knowledge of ontology (ontology and logic), so in system descriptions, it is essential to read and create various models of the system and work with models comprehensible to a computer.

To create a successful system, it is necessary to satisfy certain role interests. This satisfaction occurs through the creation of models that respond to the chosen subjects of interest linked to the system. That's why understanding system descriptions is so crucial. To bring a successful system into reality, one must engage with system descriptions. They depend on the subjects of interest of project roles.

Most of you work with numerous system descriptions. During the modeling session, try compiling a table that lists the documents you create or participate in creating, or those your colleagues have made and that you use in your work. Match each document to the system it describes. Additionally, consider which systems are outlined in your enterprise's development strategy or similar documents.

While contemporary office employees work with descriptions, it is essential not to lose sight of the physical world. Always seek the embodiment of the system. Systems thinking, foremost, concerns the physical world, even though it deals with descriptions: "Descriptions are nothing, whereas what they describe is everything." All descriptions are made solely to change what is described in the physical world!
