# System Documentation

Let’s delve deeper into documentation. You already know that system documentation is a description of the system on a physical medium. This could be a parts catalog, a product brochure, a system model on a computer, or text on paper. In English, the words suggest^[Now always pay attention to the words of your conversation partner. For example, how often do they use words from the physical world or the mental space? Or what they want to discuss right now: a substantive question, the form of presenting content, or something else?] the following: it lists objects of the physical world—a brochure, a computer model, paper. However, speaking of media, we haven't discussed the content of the description. It can be seen, read, heard, etc., and it characterizes the system according to various parameters^[By what parameters? By those of interest to numerous stakeholders.].

The concepts of "embodiment," "description," and "documentation" are needed to avoid confusion in system discussions. These concepts govern attention, helping us to discuss each aspect separately rather than mixing everything together^[Our brain doesn't have the computing power to discuss a system in multiple dimensions at once. Besides, these concepts may interest different roles.]. Let’s consider an example. A system can be a human as a biological being. It is an object of the physical world and exists "in the flesh," meaning the system "human" is literally embodied in reality. It has numerous descriptions, like height, weight, hair and skin color, etc. There is also a description in the form of a surname, first name, and middle name.

When we talk about descriptions, we understand that they are not in the physical world. Naming a person by name refers to a person's description. It resides in the mental space. However, there is also system documentation: birth certificate, passport, international passport, driver's license, and so on. These documents contain a specific description of the "human" system. Documents are present in the physical world and contain a description^[Substantive characteristic of the system.] that interests certain project roles. For example, a driver's license interests a traffic inspector. If there were no such interests, there would be no description, and there would be no need for this documentation.

The same division into embodiment, description, and system documentation applies to inanimate objects. Let’s take a milkshake as an example. On one hand, this drink in the physical world is the embodiment of the system. Meanwhile, this milkshake has various descriptions: a name, a recipe, etc. There is also system documentation on paper, stating the name and composition, and documentation in the form of a menu with a photo and price of the beverage.

Descriptions are referred to as certain characteristics or properties of the system. This information is not in the real world. For instance, you can't say that a person’s age of “42 years” is located somewhere in the physical world and has its own length-width-height-time (4D measurement). You can point to a person, but that would be the embodiment of the system. You can point to the number "42" in the physical world only if it is on a specific information carrier.

Thus, documentation can be presented in the form of an IT model, diagram, table, text on paper, or computer. Therefore, when we say "documentation," we are focusing on the information carrier. It remains a priority in the discussion until the words "embodiment" or "description" appear in the conversation.

Descriptions can be informal and formal. Most people do not realize the importance of formal descriptions and are satisfied with just informal ones. In complex projects, when working with numerous interests, formal descriptions are necessary: created by a certain method and placed on a medium. They help to understand the subject of interest better, since starting with descriptions gives you a better understanding of the stakeholders. Informal descriptions often remain in people's minds and may not be backed by a formal method of description. Much of what is just guessed in the mind is forgotten.

As discussed earlier, formal descriptions of subjects of interest are created by specific methods of description (practices). The method of description consists of a conceptual minimum and principles. This is explained in the course "Rational Work." Systems thinking relies on the knowledge of ontology (ontology and logic), so in a system description, it is necessary to be able to read and create different models of the system, as well as work with models that are understandable to the computer.

To create a successful system, certain role-based interests must be satisfied. And this satisfaction occurs through the development of models that respond to selected subjects of interest in the system. That’s why it is so important for us to understand system descriptions. To embody a successful system in reality, one must work with system descriptions. They depend on the subjects of interest of project roles.

Most of you work with numerous system descriptions. During the modeling session, try compiling a table that lists the documents you create, participate in creating, or those your colleagues have made and you use in your work process. Match each document with the system it describes. Additionally, think about which systems are described in your enterprise's development strategy or other similar documents.

Although modern office employees work with descriptions, one must not lose sight of the physical world. Always look for the embodiment of the system. Systems thinking, first and foremost, concerns the physical world, although it deals with descriptions: "descriptions are nothing, but what they describe is everything!" All descriptions are made solely to change what is described in the physical world!
