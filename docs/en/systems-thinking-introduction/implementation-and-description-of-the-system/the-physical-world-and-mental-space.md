# Physical World and Mental Space

To understand the concepts studied in this section, let's begin by distinguishing between the concepts and words that denote the physical world and the mental space.

The continuous progress in the number of interacting people and the speed of human adaptation to new conditions has become possible because people learned to communicate using signs, words, drawings, and the like. They invented letters, the alphabet, numbers, and much more to describe the physical world.

There is the word 'лев' (in Russian) or 'lion,' and there is the living creature that runs across the African plains. The living creature is a representative of the physical world, while the words 'лев' and 'lion' are descriptions of this creature. All descriptions come from the mental space. I am a person, and my description includes my name, height, etc. My photograph is also part of the description.

Thus, humans have created another "world"—the world of descriptions or mental space. This is necessary for people to change the physical world and make it better[^1]. Therefore, in any project, a system constructor uses an important thinking technique by asking themselves: "What changes in the physical world as a result of my activity?" If an action, project, or activity does not lead to a change in the physical world at some step, then there is no point in undertaking such an activity[^2]. Resources will be spent, but the world will not improve because of it[^3].

Humans have also devised theories that describe or model reality (create descriptions)[^4]. Worldviews or world models[^5] are descriptions of parts of the physical world that can be obtained using certain theories (once the possibility of taking photographs was discovered). There is no single description of the entire physical world. For example, a map is a model or description of a specific territory, not the whole universe. We understand that the territory exists in the real, physical world, and this territory can have many different descriptions (economic or political aspects, natural resources, etc.)[^6].

Descriptions of the real world can be divided into two categories: scientific and non-scientific. Scientific descriptions include theories, disciplines, and transdisciplines. Non-scientific descriptions consist of stories, legends, superstitions, and myths. The distinction lies in the fact that theories provide explanations of some part of reality that withstands scrutiny through the scientific method. These explanations do not depend on the person checking them. Moreover, a theory can be recorded using consistent symbols in the form of formulas or concepts, conveying the same substantive meaning in different languages. In contrast, non-scientific theories lack such formal rigor, although they also describe the physical world. But we will continue to talk only about scientific worldviews.

[^1]: A constructor improves the world by creating successful systems.
[^2]: Changes in the world might include impressions gained from implementing an entertainment project.
[^3]: For example, one might engage in extensive paperwork that is of no use to anyone. Or dig a pit and then fill it back in.
[^4]: And, of course, through which they create systems. But here we want to focus on descriptions.
[^5]: Note that the term "model" in this context refers more to content, although it can represent a specific object. For example, I assembled a model of an airplane.
[^6]: As you might guess, each description addresses a subject of interest in the territory.
