# Is Documentation a System? Is a Work Artifact a System?

Students often ask, "Documentation exists in the physical world, so is it a system? After all, menus, books, and passports need to be created." It's a great question, and those who ask it are delving deep.

Interestingly, the answer to this question is linked to attention. Systems thinking relies on techniques for managing attention. Often, people studying systems thinking quickly jump from one project to another, overlooking the fact that they start talking about one context and end up in another. Therefore, it's recommended to base your discussions on your not-too-complex activities that prevent you from "losing touch with reality" in your reasoning.

If we are discussing the "human" system, then the concepts of "embodiment, description, and system documentation" are tied to it. In this context, a passport, driver's license, and everything else in this project will be documentation of the "human-citizen" system. However, if you now want to discuss the passport as a system, this is a different perspective and a different project. For example, a project for manufacturing the information carrier "passport." Notice how our focus of attention has shifted.

Not everyone immediately understands how the context changes in a conversation. In the passport creation project, its content, i.e., the description of the "human-citizen" system, is not as important. The information in the passport will be discussed in the first project, where the description of the "human-citizen" system is addressed, and how to describe the citizen is determined in the first project.

In the second project, the carrier itself, not the information it contains, will be the focus. In the previous section, we already noted: "But when talking about carriers of description, we said nothing about the content of the description." The content of the passport is defined in the project concerning the person as a citizen, while the characteristics of the "passport" system primarily relate to its protection against forgery or the number of pages.

Another example. The system engineer, John Doe, is responsible for describing the car system. But ensuring this content ends up on an information carrier is the responsibility of secretary Jane Doe. Jane carefully records John's words and then prints them on A4 paper, or John himself might demonstrate the car description to colleagues on a computer. Note that the secretary isn't interested in the content, meaning the description of the "car" system.

Jane (or John, but in the role of a presenter) is interested in the information carrier. There are other projects where, for example, Jane will also play the role of an engineer creating the system—a carrier of information. This could be an A4 sheet or several stitched sheets with the system's description. In place of the A4 sheet or presentation, there could be a passport, book, website, digital twin (IT system), etc. All these carriers need to be crafted, and specific engineering roles will be engaged for this work. For instance, books are produced by printers and other publishing roles.

Therefore, one of the thinking techniques is the conscious shifting of attention across different projects [ ^1 ]. There is the content, and then there's the information carrier on which this content resides. These concepts mustn't be confused. In one project, we discuss the car as the embodiment of a system, with its description in various characteristics (subjects of interest) and documentation—on paper, in presentations, on a computer, etc. In another project, other people (or the same ones in different roles) discuss how to elegantly create a brochure, website, or digital model. Naturally, there is a connection between projects, and a systems-oriented person understands it well through the techniques of systems thinking. This means they can manage their attention if needed.

Therefore, you must also see the embodiment, description, and documentation of a system in your projects. But there could always be another project or activity where the documentation of the system is created in terms of its embodiment in the physical world. The system's content or description on this carrier is determined by your project. Don't confuse different projects.

What is a "work artifact"? A work artifact always exists in the physical world (4D). A system is also a work artifact created by a team. However, not every work artifact is a system. Besides being a system, a work artifact can also be system documentation. For instance, a car is a work artifact of an automotive corporation, but in the automotive corporation's design bureau, the team creates a work artifact—3D model of a car. This three-dimensional model serves as the system documentation of the car. In the car creation project, the 3D model (in a computer) is regarded not on its own but as the documentation of the car system. Within this documentation, the essential description of the car system is contained, serving as its information carrier.

Let's conclude with linking another trio of concepts in the next sentence: "The work artifact in the form of system documentation is created according to a certain description method." Try to understand this sentence and discuss it in a group or draft a response in the Aisystant club, providing examples from your work project.

[ ^1 ]: In section 5, we will discuss concepts such as system levels and creation chains. These ideas will aid in managing multiple projects.
