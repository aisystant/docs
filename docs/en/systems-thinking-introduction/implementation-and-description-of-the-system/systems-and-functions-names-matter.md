# Systems and Functions: Naming Matters

One common problem with understanding systems thinking is that people get confused about system names and rely too much on common sense and objective naming of physical objects [ ^1 ]. For instance, a student is asked to name a system that generates energy for a house. He describes: "This system will be called Tesla Model X electric car, which provides the main function—generating electrical energy for my house." The student further explains that this can indeed be done. We were considering a hypothetical example, so we weren't interested in the technology of connecting a Tesla to a home network.

Notice that the student's description contains a typical mistake: the words "Tesla Model X electric car" are used as a physical object-module, but it was necessary to provide the system's name (a functional name) based on the main function. Methodologically, it would be correct to say: "The Tesla Model X electric car will play the role of a generator that provides power to the house." That is, the functional name of the system is "generator," and the main function is energy generation. Alternatively, you could talk about the Tesla Model X car as a vehicle (also a functional name), which provides the main function of movement or transportation (but not energy generation).

Let's further contemplate using the example of a physical object "stone." Notice that unlike a car, there is no functional name: it's difficult to assign a function to a stone (unlike a hammer or car). The stone example illustrates that there are objective items, meaning those not initially loaded with some widespread cultural functional meaning.

Suppose you need to complete two projects: one requires fastening boards, and the other involves delivering a presentation outdoors with many papers on a table. When you describe (model) these projects, the systems and subsystems, in the first case among other systems, you would consider a system or functional object "hammer" [ ^2 ], and in the second—a "paperweight." The words "hammer" and "paperweight" convey the functional behavior of systems, from which their main functions are immediately clear. This is an example of why it's always necessary to seek system names that clearly denote the main functions.

Of course, in both projects, you might say there is a system "stone," but it would be unclear what to do with it. Although, if these aren't your first projects and you have experience, the stone in your mind automatically becomes a "hammer" in one project and a "paperweight" in another. Therefore, a professional often doesn't notice the need to name systems by their main functions. They are already accustomed to using a stone to drive nails or to weigh down papers on a desk.

The most common mistakes occur when it says "hammer" (a functional object), but the main function is indicated as holding down paper. Naturally, in everyday life anything is possible, and students might justify that the physical object hammer (where functional and modular meanings coincide) can hold down paper. But what does the system with the role "hammer" do in a project of delivering a presentation on the street? It seems nonsensical, right? Or even better: what does a "paperweight" do in a project of fastening boards?

Now, you understand that the word "hammer" can be used both as a functional name of a system and as a physical object (similar to a stone). Typically, a person understands the context intuitively in a specific everyday situation. But projects are not that simple, especially if it's a new project. You need to be aware that in one project, you have the system "hammer" (as a functional object, or if thinking about a hammer is too difficult, then say "nailer"), and this role could be performed by a stone, a microscope, etc. And accordingly, its main function is driving nails. In another project, you have the role of "paperweight," which could be performed by a stone or other physical objects—a hammer or a microscope. But the main function is holding down paper.

Systems thinking is counterintuitive, and this example demonstrates it. Many such non-obvious aspects exist within systems thinking, but they can be understood by mastering the necessary systems techniques. Then you will truly see the world anew and be able to improve it for yourself first, and then for others.

[ ^1 ]: Read Section 2 of the course and try to understand the difference between a word, a physical object, and a system. After studying subsequent Sections 3-5, you may return to this and reread it. You will likely better understand the differences between the various generations of the systems approach (from 1.0 to 3.0).

[ ^2 ]: This name has become a culturally defined concept, similar to the role name "driver."
