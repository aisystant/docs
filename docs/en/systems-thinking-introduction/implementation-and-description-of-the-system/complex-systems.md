# Complex Systems

We can discuss complex systems, referring to the relationships within their composition. At the beginning of this section, we cited the example of a cocktail. However, an embodiment of a system can also be a system composed of spatially separated 4D objects. For instance, a water rescue system includes lifeguards, boats, life rings, etc. Unlike an airplane, or a motor, these we identify as complex systems.

Complex systems are defined by the objects included in the given complex system. At the same time, we do not refer to complex systems as processes; these are different types of concepts. They must not be confused, just as you shouldn't confuse types like "furniture chair" and "color red," "cities" and "countries," "roles" and "positions," etc.

When we say "process," it means we stop examining the system, redirect our attention [ ^1 ] and now focus on the interaction between multiple systems. We can also consider a process occurring within a system.

A process is usually called a verb or a gerund. For example, the process of "nailing." It is very difficult to detect the process of nailing. Processes themselves, like changes, are invisible (remember, the process of movement is noticeable through the system). However, one can conceptualize a process by listing the physical objects involved in it. Thus, "nailing" consists of a nail, a hammer, a board, and a carpenter.

It is a bit more challenging to identify objects in the process if a stone serves as the hammer, a wall takes the place of the board, and you are the carpenter, hence forgetting to include yourself in the process.

But this reduction of "processes" to material objects that alter one another through interaction remains a reliable method for identifying work activities, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behaviors in the physical world. However, it is crucial not to forget that a process is not a system but rather an interaction of systems. This interaction is what matters. For example, the word "performance" suggests an action (process) involving actors, music, and stage. Meanwhile, a complex system is the theater itself, which includes numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, look for objects in the world expressed as nouns rather than verbs, which behave in some manner through interaction, manifesting their behavior in the world. Although it is not always possible to find exact names in terms of meaning, as they might not exist in the culture, or may be associated with other types. For example, consider what the word "dance" means: Is it a system or a process?

You can think about the most complex and simplest systems in similar ways, testifying to the universality of systems thinking. By understanding it, you will significantly save mental energy and be able to navigate the most complex situations and projects more swiftly.
