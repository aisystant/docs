# Complex Systems

We can discuss complex systems by considering the relationships within their composition. At the beginning of the section, the example with a cocktail was given. However, the embodiment of a system can be one consisting of spatially separated 4D objects. For example, a water rescue system, comprising lifeguards, lifeboats, life preservers, and the like. Unlike an airplane or engine, we will refer to such systems as complex systems.

Complex systems are defined through the objects that are included in that particular complex system. We do not call complex systems processes; these are different types of concepts. They shouldn't be confused, just as you shouldn't mix types like "furniture chair" and "color red," "cities" and "countries," "roles" and "positions," and so on.

When we say "process," it means that we stop considering the system and switch our attention^[Just as we shifted our attention from the description to the embodiment or system documentation.] to focus on the interaction of multiple systems with each other. We may also consider a process that occurs within a system.

Processes are usually referred to by verbs or verbal nouns. For example, the process of "nailing." It's very difficult to detect the nailing process. Processes themselves, akin to changes, are invisible (remember, the process of movement is noticeable through the system). However, it is possible to represent a process by listing the physical objects involved in it. That is to say, "nailing" consists of a nail, hammer, board, and carpenter.

It is somewhat harder to identify objects within the process if a stone serves as the hammer, a wall plays the role of the board, and you yourself are the carpenter, thus forgetting to include yourself in the process.

But reducing "processes" to material objects that change each other during interaction remains a reliable technique for finding work, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behaviors in the physical world. However, it's crucial never to forget that a process is not a system but an interaction of systems. It is this interaction that matters to us. For instance, the word "performance" suggests an action (process) in which actors, music, and stage participate. Meanwhile, a complex system is the theater, which encompasses numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, look for actions in the world that are not indicated by verbs, but rather by nouns - the objects that behave in some way within the interaction and exhibit their behavior to the world. Although itâ€™s not always possible to find precisely meaningful names, they may not exist in the culture, or they may be assigned to other types. For instance, consider the word "dance": is it a system or a process?

You can think about the most complex and simplest systems in more or less the same way, which testifies to the universality of systems thinking. By grasping it, you will significantly save mental energy and be able to handle the most complex situations and projects more efficiently.
