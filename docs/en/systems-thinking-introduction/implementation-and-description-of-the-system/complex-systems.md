# Complex Systems

We can talk about complex systems by referring to the relationships within their composition. At the start of this section, there was an example involving a cocktail. However, a system's embodiment can be based on 4D objects separated in space. For example, consider a water rescue system, which includes lifeguards, lifeboats, life rings, and so forth. Unlike an airplane or an engine, we will refer to these types of systems as complex systems.

Complex systems are defined by the objects that are included in the given complex system. It's important that we do not confuse complex systems with processes; these are different types of concepts. They cannot be muddled, much like how you cannot confuse categories like "furniture" and "chair," "color red" and "cities," or "roles" and "positions," etc.

When we say "process," it means that we stop considering the system and shift our focus [ ^1 ] to the interaction among several systems. We can even examine a process occurring within a system.

Processes are usually referred to by a verb or a gerund. For example, the process of "nailing." It is very difficult to detect the process of nailing. Processes themselves, as changes, are invisible (remember that movement is noticed through the system). But we can envision a process as a list of physical items involved. Thus, "nailing" consists of the nail, hammer, board, and carpenter.

It's a bit more challenging to identify objects in a process when the role of the hammer is played by a stone, the role of the board by a wall, and you yourself perform as the carpenter, often forgetting to include yourself in the process.

However, reducing "processes" to material objects that alter each other during interaction remains a reliable method for identifying tasks, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behavior in the physical world. Yet, it is crucial not to forget that a process is not a system but rather the interaction of systems. This interaction is what is important. For example, the word "spectacle" indicates that an action (process) occurs involving actors, music, and a stage. Meanwhile, the complex system is the theater, which encompasses numerous systems.

To make sense of complex systems and processes, look for nouns representing objects in the world rather than verb-based actions. These objects interact and exhibit behavior within the world. Although it may not always be possible to find precisely meaningful names, they might not exist in the culture, or perhaps they are associated with different types. For example, consider the meaning of the word "dance": Is it a system or a process?

Thinking about the most complex and the simplest systems in more or less the same way demonstrates the universality of systems thinking. Understanding it will notably conserve your mental energy and enable you to navigate the most complicated situations and projects more quickly.
