# Systems and Functions: The Importance of Names

One common problem in understanding systems thinking is that people get confused about system names and overly rely on common sense and the objective naming of physical objects [ ^1 ]. For example, a student is asked to name a system that generates energy for a home. He describes, "This system will be called Tesla Model X electric vehicle, which performs the main function—generating electric energy for my home." The student further explains that this is indeed possible. It was an academic example, so we were not concerned with the technology of connecting a Tesla to the home network.

Notice that there is a typical mistake in the student's description: the words "Tesla Model X electric vehicle" were used as a physical object or module, whereas what was needed was the system's name (a functional name) based on its main function. Methodologically speaking, it would have been correct to say: "The Tesla Model X electric vehicle will act as a generator that will provide electric energy for the home." In this case, the system's functional name is "generator," and its main function is energy generation. Alternatively, one could speak of the Tesla Model X as a vehicle (also a functional name) that performs the main function of moving or transporting (but not energy generation).

Let's consider another example with the physical object "stone." Notice that in this case, unlike with a vehicle, there is no functional name: it is difficult to assign a function to a stone (unlike a hammer or a vehicle). The stone example, in this sense, effectively demonstrates that there are objective objects, i.e., those not initially burdened with some culturally widespread functional meaning.

Suppose you need to carry out two projects: in one you need to join boards together, and in the other, you are delivering a presentation outdoors with many sheets of paper on the table. When you describe (or model) these projects, systems, and subsystems, in the first case, among other systems, you will consider the system or functional object "hammer" [ ^2 ], and in the second, "paperweight." The words "hammer" and "paperweight" convey the functional behavior of systems, immediately indicating their main functions. This is an example of the necessity always to seek system names that clearly denote main functions.

Of course, you can say that both projects have a "stone" system, but there may be little understanding of what to do with it. Although if these are not your first projects and you have experience, then in your mind, a stone automatically turns into a "hammer" in one project and a "paperweight" in the other. Therefore, professionals often do not notice the necessity of naming systems by their main functions. They are already accustomed to using a stone for driving nails or pressing down papers on a table.

The most common errors arise when someone writes "hammer" (a functional object) but indicates the main function as holding paper. In everyday life, anything is possible, and a student might argue that the physical object, the hammer (where functional and modular meanings coincide), could hold paper. But what does the system as a role "hammer" do in a project involving speaking to an audience outdoors? That's nonsense. Even better: what does a "paperweight" do in a project involving joining boards together?

Now you understand that the word "hammer" can be used as a functional system name and as a physical object (analogous to a stone). Typically, a person understands from context and intuitively what is being discussed in a specific real-life situation. But in projects, things are not so simple, especially if it is a new project. You need to realize that in one project, your system is a "hammer" (as a functional object, or if a hammer is too complex, call it a "nail driver"), and this role can be fulfilled by a stone, a microscope, etc. Its main function is to drive nails. In another project, there is the role of "paperweight" which can be fulfilled by a stone or other physical objects—a hammer or a microscope. But the main function is to hold papers.

Systems thinking is counterintuitive, and this example illustrates that. There are many such non-obvious things in systems thinking, but they can be understood by mastering the necessary systems techniques. Then you will truly see the world in a new way and be able to improve it first for yourself and then for others.

[ ^1 ]: Please read section 2 of the course and try to understand the difference between a word, a physical object, and a system. After studying the following sections 3–5, you can return to this and reread it. You are likely to better understand the difference between different generations of the systems approach (from 1.0 to 3.0).

[ ^2 ]: This name has become a culturally conditioned concept, like the role name "driver."
