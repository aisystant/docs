# System Description and Embodiment

At Aisystant, the course "Rational Work" teaches the separation of the physical world and mental space in speech or writing. This course also trains the skill of tying abstract reasoning to the physical world. People cannot do without mental concepts, as they facilitate communication. However, one must not lose sight of physical-world objects behind words and symbols. "Losing touch with reality" is particularly discouraged in project activities, as it makes creating successful systems challenging.

For example, an insolvency practitioner in enterprise bankruptcy may mistakenly believe that the purpose of their activity is to register the company's liquidation data. However, this record is merely information certifying that the company's remaining assets are distributed among creditors. These assets exist in the physical world, representing the practitioner's goal and system. The registry entry merely describes this system. Thus, in any activity, one must distinguish between the system and its description. This mindset (and skill) requires training. However, first, it is essential to thoroughly understand the concepts of "system embodiment" and "system description."

In systems thinking, the concepts of "system embodiment" and "system description" pertain to different realms. "Embodiment" refers to the object in the material and physical world, while "description" emphasizes that the reasoning pertains to the mental space, which is not the flesh of the system.

In this context, the concept of "system embodiment" may seem tautological because when we say "system," we understand it as referring to a physical object embodied in reality. However, the word "embodiment" is deliberately used with "system" to contrast it with the phrase "system description." Often when discussing "system embodiment," "system description" is also discussed concurrently [ ^1 ].

A system's embodiment can be an individual system as a physical object. For example, the "Blue Lagoon" cocktail in hand or a specific pencil. These objects are literally represented in the physical world and exist in four dimensions (4D): length-width-height and time [ ^2 ].

When we describe a system, we use words and terms that define its characteristics, properties, actions, features, behaviors, states, and more. Consider terms like color, price, height, weight, desires, and so on. These words are different from words like "car," "table," or "clock," which denote physical objects.

To describe a system, one must be proficient in specific description methods [ ^3 ]. Each characteristic requires its own worldviews, theories, and disciplines. If you need to describe a car's price, you must know the pricing practices (description methods), and if it's an enterprise for a shareholder, an understanding of financial reporting under IFRS or US GAAP and the specific technology for drafting the necessary financial documents (e.g., SAP) is essential.

System descriptions are inherently abstract. This concept is necessary to draw attention to the substantive aspect of the discussed system. However, descriptions can be tied to the physical world, that is, focus on form. To achieve this, one should examine the information carrier on which the system's description data will reside. This brings us to "system documentation" [ ^4 ].

Using the concept of "system documentation" emphasizes the focus on the physical medium containing the system description [ ^5 ]. For example, a menu is the documentation of the "cocktail" system, containing the cocktail's description: its ingredients, price, photo, and so on.

Documentation is often created using tools (technologies) that implement a specific discipline used to describe the system. For example, "Financial Statements under US GAAP" documentation is generated using the SAP IT system.

Thus, understanding the difference between the concepts of system embodiment, description, and documentation, and identifying these concepts in one's life, is an important mental process. Without the skill of promptly distinguishing these concepts, further study of systems thinking notions will be impossible.

[ ^1 ]: Therefore, you may simply use the term "system" without the word "embodiment." But if you wish to draw attention to separately considering the system and its description, you can use the terms "system embodiment" and "system description."
[ ^2 ]: Note that this is not an abstract chair or car, which lacks attachment to physical space and time.
[ ^3 ]: For more on this concept, see section 6.
[ ^4 ]: When discussing system description, it signifies the importance of the content or essence characterizing a particular system. Meanwhile, when mentioning documentation, the focus is on the fact that this content can be read, viewed, calculated, etc., on a specific medium. The more concepts, the more confusion. But by studying these concepts, order and clarity emerge.
[ ^5 ]: When you hear or read the word "description," determine from the context whether it refers to a genuine "description" or a "document with a description." Often "description" can mean both.
