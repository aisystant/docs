# Example: How to Prepare for a Trip Using a Systems Approach

I'm planning another trip and decided to travel light, so I'm bringing a small carry-on suitcase. There's no room for extra things, so I need to take only the essentials. While picking my items, I came up with a methodological example to explain several systems thinking concepts.

What should we think about? We're going to discuss different types of objects—functional and physical.

An item or object can be considered from a functional perspective, where its function is important to us. Alternatively, we might focus on its physical characteristics, in which case we need to see it in reality.

On this trip, I'll need shorts and swim trunks. Usually, we're not aware of the objects we're dealing with. But even if we don't differentiate between the concepts of "functional object" and "physical object," it doesn't stop us from making the right decision in this everyday example. However, when creating complex systems, distinguishing between these two concepts becomes extremely useful. That's the essence of systems thinking.

Let's start packing. "Shorts" and "swim trunks" at the packing stage are functional objects, not specific physical ones. Shorts and swim trunks have different functions, and understanding this is crucial in the design process.

Now, I'm envisioning the trip and the necessary systems that will be used in it. Therefore, I'm thinking about systems as functional objects: what I will need (functional objects) to be fully prepared and able to perform various roles.

When I model the future, I think primarily about functional objects.

Let's set some constraints. Next, due to the suitcase's size, I decide that I can take only one specific physical item (physical object) that can serve as either shorts or swim trunks depending on the situation.

Not every item can fulfill both roles simultaneously (a role is synonymous with a functional object). Fortunately, I found something that fits the bill: long blue swim trunks-shorts from Boss. They'll perform the functions of shorts or swim trunks, and I'll take them on the trip. Now, in different situations, I'll use the specific physical object—long swim trunks-shorts.

Let's understand how concepts are structured. The objects and things surrounding us are named by the words commonly used in society. In culture, it's often customary to name objects based on their primary functional use.

We can say that items called "shorts" and "swim trunks" inherited their names from their respective functional objects. For instance, shorts evolved from shortened trousers, and an airplane or a system designed to enable flight got its name as an object whose main function is to enable flight.

Let's practice systems thinking. A great skill for a systems thinker is to distinguish the context in which words like "shorts" and "swim trunks" are used. In every statement, you can track whether it's about functional objects or specific physical instances (objects, things).

For example, consider these two statements: "I think I will need shorts on the trip" and "I will take these blue shorts with me." In both sentences, the word "shorts" is used, but in the first sentence, it is a functional example, and in the second—it's physical.

This skill, among many other systems thinking skills, will be especially useful when dealing with systems in your work projects.
