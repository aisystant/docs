# Example: How to Prepare for a Trip Using a Systems Approach

I'm getting ready for another trip. I've decided to travel light, so I'm taking a small carry-on suitcase. There's no room for extra items, so I need to bring only the essentials. This process of selecting items led to a methodological example: how to explain several concepts of systems thinking.

What should you consider? We'll be discussing different types of objects—functional and physical.

An item or object can be viewed from a functional perspective, where its function is of interest to us. Alternatively, we might focus on its physical characteristics, necessitating a real-life view of the object.

On my trip, I’ll need shorts and swim trunks. Typically, we're not aware of the types of objects we're dealing with. Even if we don't distinguish between the concepts of "functional object" and "physical object," this doesn't prevent us from making the right decision in this everyday example. However, when creating complex systems, distinguishing these two concepts is incredibly useful. This is the essence of systems thinking.

Let's start packing. At the packing stage, "shorts" and "swim trunks" are functional objects, not specific physical ones. Shorts and swim trunks have different functions, and understanding this is crucial in the design process.

As I plan the trip and the necessary systems to be used, I think of systems as functional objects: what I will need (functional objects) to be well-equipped and able to perform various roles.

When I model the future, I primarily think about functional objects.

Let's set some constraints. Due to the size of the suitcase, I've decided I can only take one specific physical item (physical object) that will serve as either shorts or swim trunks, depending on the situation.

Not any item can suit both roles simultaneously (here, a role is synonymous with a functional object). Fortunately, I have found such an item: long blue swim-short hybrids from Boss. They will perform the functions of shorts or swim trunks. These are what I'm taking on the trip. Now, in different situations, I will use the specific physical object—long swim-short hybrids.

Let's understand how concepts are structured. The objects and items around us are named with the words commonly accepted by society. It's often a cultural convention to name objects according to their primary functional use.

We can say that the items labeled as "shorts" and "swim trunks" have inherited their names from the functions of their respective functional objects. Thus, shorts evolved from shortened trousers, and an airplane—as an object, whose main function is to enable flight—is aptly named.

Let's practice systems thinking. A good skill for a systems thinker is distinguishing the context of using the words "shorts" and "swim trunks." In every statement, you can trace whether it refers to functional objects or specific physical instances (objects, items).

For example, consider these two statements: "I think I will need shorts on the trip" and "I'm taking these blue shorts with me." In both sentences, the word "shorts" is used, but in the first sentence, it refers to a functional example, and in the second, a physical one.

This skill, among many other systems thinking skills, will be particularly valuable when you're dealing with systems in your work projects.
