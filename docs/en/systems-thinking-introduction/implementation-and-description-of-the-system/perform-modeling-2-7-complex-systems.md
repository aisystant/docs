# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.7. Complex Systems

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material and utilize the AI bot Aisystant if needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If you lack the perspective to select appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with familiar experts.

Provide examples from work and personal projects by listing the subsystems of your enterprise's systems. If needed, create notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record your reflections or questions for later discussion in support chats or jot down ideas for future drafts. You can also leave feedback for course developers in the "Notes."

Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
