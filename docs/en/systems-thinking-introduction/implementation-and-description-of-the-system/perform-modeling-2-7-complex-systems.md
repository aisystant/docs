**Review the examples in the initial rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material and utilize AI Assistant where needed. Fill in the blank cells in the rows following the examples. If you lack the knowledge to come up with the required words and designations (names), make use of ChatGPT or Google, or consult with familiar experts.**

**Provide examples from work and personal projects by listing the subsystems of your enterprise's systems. Create notes for further elaboration if necessary. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can write reflections or questions to ask in support chats later, or jot down thoughts for future preparation. You can also leave feedback for course developers in the "Notes" section.**
