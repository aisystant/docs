# Conduct Modeling: 2.7. Complex Systems

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material and feel free to use the AI-bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your perspective isn't broad enough to select the right words and designations (names), you can use ChatGPT or Google or consult with familiar experts.

Provide examples from work and personal projects by listing subsystems of your enterprise's systems. If necessary, create notes for further processing. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write reflections or a question to ask in support chats later, or record a thought for future preparation. You can also leave feedback for course developers in the "Notes."

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
