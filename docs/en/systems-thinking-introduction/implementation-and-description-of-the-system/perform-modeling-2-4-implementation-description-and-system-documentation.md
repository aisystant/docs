Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the presented data can apply to many different situations; you only need to provide at least one example. The main thing is to avoid obvious mistakes.

For your current or past projects (or projects of your friends that you are familiar with), fill in the table by specifying at least five realizations of the system, descriptions of this system, and documents with the system's descriptions.

It's sufficient to provide one example of a description and one document with this description for each realization of the system, but you can include more. One realization might have many descriptions, and one description could be documented on various media/in various documents. Write in the table only the names of the requested items; there's no need to insert full texts and diagrams!

Create notes for subsequent analysis as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record insights that arise while using thinking through writing during the table completion process.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
