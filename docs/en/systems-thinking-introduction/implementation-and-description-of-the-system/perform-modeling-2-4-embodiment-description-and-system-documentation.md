# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.4. System Embodiment, Description, and Documentation

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the provided data can fit a variety of different situations; you need to provide at least one example. The main goal is to avoid methodological errors.

For your current or past projects (or those familiar to your friends), fill in the table with at least five instances of the system embodiment, descriptions of this system, and documents containing these descriptions.

One example of description and one document with this description per system embodiment is sufficient, but you can include more: one embodiment might have many descriptions, and one description might be documented across various media or in different documents. Only include the names of what is asked for in the table; do not include full texts or diagrams!

Create notes for further elaboration if necessary. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can record your insights that arise when applying thinking through writing while filling in the table.

Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
