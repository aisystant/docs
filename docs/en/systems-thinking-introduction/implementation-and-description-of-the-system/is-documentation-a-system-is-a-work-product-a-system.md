# Is Documentation a System? Is a Work Artifact a System?

Students often pose the question: "Since documentation exists in the physical world, does that make it a system? After all, menus, books, and passports all need to be produced." This is a good question, and those who ask it are digging deeper.

Strangely enough, the answer to this question is related to attention. Systems thinking relies on attention management techniques. Often, people studying systems thinking quickly jump from one project to another and lose track, starting by discussing one context and finishing with another. Therefore, it is recommended to base your exploration on a not-too-complex activity to avoid "losing touch with reality" in your reasoning.

When discussing the "human" system, we tie concepts like "embodiment, description, and system documentation" to it. In this context, a passport, a driver's license, and everything else in this project will be documentation for the "human-citizen" system. However, if you now want to discuss the passport as a system, that's a different perspective and a different project—such as a project focused on producing the information carrier "passport." Note how our focus of attention has shifted.

Not everyone immediately grasps how the context changes in conversation. In a passport creation project, the content—i.e., the description of the "human-citizen" system—is not as important. The information in the passport will be discussed in the first project, where it pertains to the description of the "human-citizen" system. Consequently, decisions on how to describe a citizen are made in the first project.

In the second project, the main focus will be the carrier itself, not the information it contains. In the previous section, we already noted: "But when discussing description carriers, we said nothing about the content of the description itself." The passport's content is determined in the project about the human as a citizen, while the characteristics of the "passport" system are primarily related to its security against forgery or the number of pages.

Here's another example. System engineer John Doe is responsible for describing the automobile system. However, ensuring that this content appears on an information carrier is the responsibility of the secretary, Jane Doe. Jane will carefully transcribe John's words and then print them on A4 paper, or John might present the automobile description to his colleagues on a computer. Note that the secretary is not interested in the content, which is the description of the "automobile" system.

Jane (or John, but in this case as a speaker) is interested in the information carrier. There are other projects where, for example, Jane will also play the role of the engineer who creates the system—the information carrier. This could be a sheet of A4 paper or a few stitched sheets with the system description. Instead of A4 paper or a presentation, it could be a passport, book, website, digital twin (IT system), etc. All these carriers must be produced, and various engineering roles will be involved in this work. For example, a printer and other publishing roles release a book.

Therefore, one thinking technique is the conscious movement of attention across different projects [ ^1 ]. There is content, and there is an information carrier on which this content resides. These concepts should not be confused. In one project, we discuss the automobile as an embodiment of a system, its descriptions in the form of various characteristics (subjects of interest), and documentation on paper, in presentations, on the computer, etc. In another project, different people (or the same ones, in different roles) discuss how to skillfully create a brochure, website, or digital model. Of course, there is a connection between these projects, and a systems-oriented person understands it well due to the effective approaches of systems thinking. Thus, they can manage their focus when necessary.

Therefore, you also need to see the embodiment, description, and documentation of the system in any of your projects. However, there may always be another project or other activities where system documentation is created from the perspective of its physical embodiment. The content or description of a system on this carrier is determined by your project. Don't get confused between different projects.

What is a "work artifact"? A work artifact always exists in the physical world (4D). A system is also a work artifact created by a team. However, not every work artifact is a system. Besides systems, a work artifact can be the documentation of a system. For example, a car is a work artifact of an automotive corporation, but in the design bureau of the automotive corporation, the team creates a work artifact—a 3D model of the car. This three-dimensional model is documentation of the car system. In the car creation project, the 3D model (on a computer) is not considered in isolation but as documentation of the car system. This documentation serves as a carrier containing an important description of the car system.

Let's conclude by linking another trio of concepts in the following sentence: "A work artifact in the form of system documentation is created according to some description method." Try to comprehend this sentence and discuss it with your group or draft an example in the AISYSTANT club, providing examples from a work project.
