# Perform Modeling: 2.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and alongside them, indicate the concepts they are most strongly connected to for you. Other concepts can come from your current worldview, meaning you donâ€™t have to list only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with fellow students, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, link different concepts together, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task in your modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.
