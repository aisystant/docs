# Perform Modeling: 2.1. Concepts

Write down the five or more most memorable concepts from this section and note the concepts with which they are most strongly connected for you. Other concepts may come from your current worldviews, so you donâ€™t have to only list the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with your classmates, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, try to explain these concepts in simple language, provide examples from your experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.

In the modeling workspace, find the corresponding assignment by its number and complete all of its components.
