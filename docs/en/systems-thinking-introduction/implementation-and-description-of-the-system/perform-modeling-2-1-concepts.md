List the top five or more concepts from this section that stood out to you, and next to them, note the concepts with which they are most strongly connected in your mind. These additional concepts may come from your current worldviews; you donâ€™t have to limit yourself to the core concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or friends. For instance, try explaining these concepts in simple terms, providing examples from your own experience, connecting different concepts with each other, or explaining their importance.
