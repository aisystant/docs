# The Physical World and Mental Space

To grasp the concepts explored in this section, let's begin by distinguishing concepts and words that signify the physical world and mental space.

The continual progress in the number of interacting people and the speed at which humans adapt to new conditions has been made possible because people learned to communicate through signs, words, drawings, and so on. They invented letters, alphabets, numbers, and much more to describe the physical world.

There is the word "лев" (in Russian) or "lion," and then there is the living creature that runs across the African plains. The living creature is a representative of the physical world, whereas the words "лев" and "lion" are descriptions of this creature. All descriptions originate from mental space. I am a person, and my description includes my name, height, etc. My photograph also belongs to the realm of description.

Thus, humans have invented another "world"—the world of descriptions or mental space. This world is crucial for humans to change the physical world and make it better[^1]. Therefore, in any project, a system constructor uses an important cognitive technique by asking themselves: "What changes in the physical world as a result of my activities?" If an action, project, or activity doesn't lead to some change in the physical world at a certain step, then it doesn't make sense to pursue that activity[^2]. Resources would be spent without making the world a better place[^3].

Humans have also come up with theories that describe or model reality (create descriptions)[^4]. Worldviews or models[^5] of the world are descriptions of part of the physical world that can be obtained through certain theories (there was once a time when the possibility of taking photographs was discovered). However, there is no single description of the entire physical world. For example, a geographical map is a model or description of a specific territory, not the entire universe. We understand that the territory exists in the real, physical world. This territory can have multiple different descriptions (economic or political aspects, natural resources, etc.)[^6].

Descriptions of the real world can be divided into two categories: scientific and non-scientific. Scientific descriptions include theories, disciplines, transdisciplines. Non-scientific descriptions encompass stories, legends, superstitions, myths. The difference between them is that theories provide an explanation for some portion of reality that withstands scrutiny by the scientific method, and this doesn't depend on the verifier. Moreover, a theory can be recorded with uniform symbols in the form of formulas or concepts, conveying the same substantive meaning across different languages. In contrast, non-scientific theories lack such formal rigor, although they also describe the physical world. However, we will focus further only on scientific worldviews.

[^1]: A constructor makes the world better through the creation of successful systems.
[^2]: Changes in the world can be considered as impressions you receive from implementing an entertainment project.
[^3]: You could, hypothetically, engage in a large amount of paperwork that no one needs. Or dig a hole and then fill it in.
[^4]: And, naturally, through which systems are created. But here, we want to focus on descriptions.
[^5]: Note that the word "model" in this context addresses content rather than merely a specific object. For example, here I have assembled a model airplane.
[^6]: As you've probably guessed, each description responds to a particular subject of interest concerning the territory.
