# Role Executors: Agents and Their Intentions, Strategy, and Plans

When dealing with roles, it's essential not to overlook the role executor acting as an agent. An agent can be a person or another entity (organization, teams, or soon AI) that intends to take actions to address dissatisfaction. A person is a broad concept [ ^1 ]. We need to focus on the dissatisfactions and desires that drive a person's actions.

When it comes to people, there's a risk of delving into psychological terminology, which is less formal and doesn't suit systems modeling. Thus, to discuss the human agent, we introduce the concept of "intention." [ ^2 ]. Intention allows us to address the executor, not the role. Thus, "preference" relates to the role, while "intention" pertains to the role executor.

In the textbook "Systems Self-Development," a framework linking psychology and systems thinking was introduced. Here, we refine it slightly. Feeling dissatisfaction, the human agent intends to assume a role to eliminate this dissatisfaction through action by means of a method. Simultaneously, the agent, in the role, uses this method to contribute to the creation of some system.

An agent acts according to a role, thus pursuing the role preference (preference) towards the system. However, the agent can also dynamically switch between roles, allowing us to observe changes in preferences. For example, we may expect a person to play one role and pursue its corresponding role interests, but then they might switch roles and pursue a different set of role interests, even possibly relating to a completely different system. To manage the agent's intentions, specific practices are required [ ^3 ], primarily systems leadership. Systems leadership is a method for placing an executor-agent in a project role. An inanimate physical object is placed in a role through traditional engineering methods [ ^4 ], whereas for a human agent, systems leadership fulfills that function.

The concept of "intention" is primarily needed to identify specific individuals connected to your system and project. By focusing on these individuals, you can pinpoint project roles, or conversely, link project roles to specific people.

It often happens that you are surrounded by many people, but you cannot discern their intentions and thus don't understand if they are stakeholders [ ^5 ]. Conversely, you might be working in a small team or find nobody around, yet there are people somewhere who want something from you or your project. By identifying these people's intentions, you can better understand if they are stakeholders and what specific roles they play concerning your system.

Therefore, when working with project roles, it's crucial to know all the executors and their intentions. If the executors' intentions are not linked to your project's roles, then you've either selected the wrong executors or need to modify their intentions.

[ ^1 ]: For example, speaking of a person, one might also consider an organism and its structure. But we won't do this, so the concept "agent" helps narrow down the broad concept of "person."

[ ^2 ]: Don't confuse intention, which pertains to the human agent or executor, with preference, which pertains to the role. Thus, it's correct to say: “the person intends to take action” and “the person in the role has a role interest” or “the role has a role interest.” From a systems thinking perspective, it is incorrect to say that "a role has an intention" and that "a person pursues a role interest."

[ ^3 ]: Essentially, this refers to creating a system designed to fulfill a specific role. However, this system is not made from metal, plastic, or other materials, but from "flesh and blood." If an inanimate system is engineered through technical methods, a biological system requires more. If you need to operate at the level of body parts, you'll need to involve medical professionals; at the gene level, neurobiologists; and at the whole organism level, trainers (e.g., teaching swimming), instructors (teaching professional methods), and systems leaders (helping to assume the correct roles).

[ ^4 ]: For example, mechanical engineering "places" a specific "M-1245 Engine" in the role of a vehicle engine.

[ ^5 ]: A person may play a different role in the discussion process, one unrelated to your project. The actor-person at this moment intends to play a role other than what you expect, thus you don't have a stakeholder role, or rather, no actor in that role. Here, systems leadership is needed if you want to change the intention of the actor-person.
