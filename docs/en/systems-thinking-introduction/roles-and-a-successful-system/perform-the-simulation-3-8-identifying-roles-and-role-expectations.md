# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations

Review the example in the first row of the table. Notice how a well-formulated action suggests a role. Some roles are culturally influenced, meaning they are widely recognized. Try to identify them, utilizing ChatGPT, Google, or consulting familiar experts. Survey three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not just a desk job; you'll need to engage with different people! Don’t postpone this—start today. For instance, write, call, or chat over coffee with colleagues. Do not record information about colleagues that you already know!

Then, fill in a row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Begin to describe your activities however you can, and then adjust. Write a draft about this in the AISYSTANT blog.

Locate the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its parts.
