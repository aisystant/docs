# Conduct the Modeling: 3.5. Roles Played by the Manager

Review the example provided in the first row of the table. Record at least three roles that you are aware your manager has performed over the past few months (if possible, arrange them in order of when they were carried out). Don't forget roles such as "strategist," "leader," "organizer," and other managerial and entrepreneurial roles as organizational engineers' roles (unlike technical engineers, enterprise engineers often do not consider this work, but it indeed isâ€”requiring mastery and considerable time and resource investment). If you lack the insight to choose the right words and labels (names), consider using ChatGPT or Google, or consult with acquaintances who are experts.

List the roles you perform in the position of a leader in a work or personal project. If you think you're not a leader anywhere, that is a mistake. If necessary, use thinking through writing to contemplate this question.

Locate the corresponding task by number in your modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
