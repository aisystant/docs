# Subject of Interest, Role Interest, or Preference

Let's delve deeper into the concepts of "subject of interest" and "role interest" (preference). It's essential to remember that if we are discussing a project role (where the executor is an agent), it automatically implies that this role has a specific subject of interest in the system; in other words, there is something in the system that interests it. Ultimately, systems thinking values not so much the roles as the characteristics of the system that are necessary for these roles. Through the roles and their methods, one can access these system characteristics. We can say that a role is concerned with certain important subjects of interest within the system.

A subject of interest is an important characteristic of a system, and it's vital to maintain this mental approach of separating discussion of the "system" from the "subjects of interest." For instance, a car system can be characterized by cost, speed, color, design, and many other factors ^[The international standard ISO 42010 provides a sample list of subjects of interest: functionality, attainability, usage, system purpose, system capabilities, system properties, known limitations, structure, behavior, efficiency/performance, resource usage, reliability, protection, information integrity and security, complexity, ability to evolve, openness, execution parallelism, autonomy, cost, schedule, quality of service, flexibility in use, development flexibility, modifiability, modularity, management, inter-process communications, deadlocks, state changes, subsystem integration, data availability, privacy, legal compliance, justifications, organizational objectives and strategies, user experience, maintainability, price acceptability, and ease of decommissioning and disposal. As you understand, this list is not exhaustive; different systems may have other characteristics (subjects of interest).]. A buyer is interested in the cost of the car, so we can say that the buyer's subject of interest is the price (or cost). Note that the subject of interest in the system belongs to the role, not the agent (performer of the role). John Doe or Andrew Smith as the buyer^[Role performers may vary, but this mental approach allows temporarily highlighting what they have in common: their interest in the car's price.] have the same subject of interest in the car's price.

It's important not to confuse subjects of interest with functions of the system. Different systems can have unique functions, but subjects of interest are often common to many systems. For example, a chair and a table have different functions, but subjects of interest related to these systems can be the same: cost, size, stability, reliability, and so on.

It should be noted that important characteristics of the system are, in and of themselves, an individual subject of interest for the architect's role. Thus, system characteristics are precisely what the system architect needs for their work. For example, an architect is interested in subjects of interest such as reliability, safety, resilience, scalability, availability, continuity, performance, configurability, extensibility, reusability, localization, maintainability, portability, upgradeability, and so on.

The architect works with these subjects of interest (highlighting the most important ones), which are called architectural characteristics, leading to constructive solutions^[The system design is like a "transparent box."]. or a proposal for dividing the system into specific modules ^[More about this in the "Systems Engineering" course.]. Architectural solutions help to divide the system into modules. You don't have to know architectural methods or work as an architect, but you should understand the essence of architectural work from the perspective of systems thinking: what the architect does and what their work artifact is. Similarly, you may not know how to perform plumbing work in your apartment, but you are well-informed about what a plumber does, and you can assign tasks to them and accept their work.

Various roles can have the same subject of interest. However, the role interest for these roles may differ. Hence, another concept is introducedâ€”preference^[For example, by making decisions about the modularity of a system, an architect offers different options for these preferences: the more/less a certain subject of interest, the better. This becomes a matter of negotiation and compromises in satisfying the project roles' interests. Preference is often used as a synonym for "role interest."]. It indicates what a specific role desires in terms of the subjects of interest. The cost is of interest not only to the buyer but also the seller; however, their preferences or role interests differ. The subject of interest is the same, but the buyer prefers a lower price, and the seller prefers a higher price. Thus, the preferences (or role interests) of the roles are different, even when the subject of interest is the same.

Defining a project role simultaneously suggests that there are specific subjects of interest. The names of project roles in culture are tied to the subjects of interest in the system. A manager's subject of interest in the "enterprise" system includes timelines, finances, budget, etc. In other words, the manager is interested not in the entire enterprise but in its specific characteristics. Other roles focus on different system characteristics^[A practices manager is interested in the methods and practices employed within the enterprise. For example, this role would be interested in which IT program is used at the automotive corporation's project bureau: does it allow drawing in 2D or 3D?]. You might also imagine interest as a variable, and preference as its specific value.

Knowledge of subjects of interest, like knowledge of project role names, is part of a general outlook. Most people have a well-developed activity-based outlook in the field of medicine. Some have a far better outlook in medicine than in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. You know there are many different doctors, and you even have an idea of their subjects of interest. For example, you can differentiate between a therapist and a pediatrician; you understand what otolaryngologists and dentists are interested in. However, unless you have a special interest, you might struggle to name even three roles within the "engineers" or "managers" class. Therefore, studying systems thinking should be followed by studying systems management and systems engineering^[These are transdisciplinary insights that will benefit any specialist seeking a strong intellect.].

A successful constructor needs to understand roles and interests in project activities in general much better than in any particular area. Our educational program is aimed precisely at developing a broad outlook.
