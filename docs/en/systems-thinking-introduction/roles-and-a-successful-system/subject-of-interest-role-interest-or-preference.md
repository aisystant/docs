# Subject of Interest, Role Interest, or Preference

Let's delve deeper into the concepts of "subject of interest" and "role interest" (preference). It's important to remember that if we're talking about a project role (the executor is the agent), it automatically implies that this role has a specific subject of interest in the system; something within it captures their attention. Ultimately, systems thinking prioritizes not so much the roles as the system's attributes essential to those roles. Through roles and their methods, one can access the system's characteristics. It can be said that a role is concerned with certain important subjects of interest in the system.

A subject of interest is an important characteristic of the system, and it's crucial for us to use the mental technique of separating "system" from "subjects of interest" in discussions. For example, a vehicle system can be characterized by cost, speed, color, design, and many other features [ ^1 ]. A buyer is interested in the cost of a vehicle, so we can say that their subject of interest is the price (or cost). Note that the subject of interest in a system belongs to the role, not the agent (executor of the role). John Doe or Andrew Smith, in the role of a buyer [ ^2 ], share the same subject of interest concerning the price of a vehicle.

At the same time, subjects of interest should not be confused with system functions. Functions of different systems can be unique, yet subjects of interest often overlap across numerous systems. For instance, chairs and tables have different functions, but the subjects of interest in these systems might be named similarly: cost, size, stability, reliability, etc.

It is important to note that significant characteristics of a system are independently essential—identifying and implementing them belong to the role of the architect. Thus, for an architect’s work, the system's characteristics are necessary. For example, an architect is interested in subjects of interest such as reliability, safety, stability, scalability, availability, continuity, performance, configurability, expandability, reusability, localization, maintainability, portability, upgradeability, and so on.

The architect works with these subjects of interest (selecting the most crucial ones), which are termed architectural characteristics, resulting in a constructive solution [ ^3 ] or a proposal for dividing the system into specific modules [ ^4 ]. The architectural solution helps segment the system into modules. You are not required to know architectural methods or work as an architect, but you must understand the essence of architectural work from a systems thinking perspective: what the architect does and what their work product is. Similarly, you might not perform plumbing in a home, but you are familiar with a plumber's work and could even set tasks for and evaluate their work.

Various roles can have the same subject of interest. However, their role interest might differ. This introduces the concept of preference [ ^5 ]. It indicates what a specific role wants within the subject of interest. Cost concerns both the buyer and the seller, but their preferences or role interests differ. The subject of interest is the same, yet the buyer prefers a lower price, while the seller prefers a higher one. Thus, preferences (or role interests) of the roles differ while the subject of interest remains the same.

When defining a project role, you are also implying particular subjects of interest. The names of project roles in culture are linked to the subjects of interest in the system. The manager’s subject of interest in the "enterprise" system includes timings, finances, budget, etc. That is, the manager is interested not in the whole enterprise but only in certain characteristics. Other roles are interested in different characteristics of the system [ ^6 ]. Furthermore, you can imagine that interest is a variable, while preference is its specific value.

Knowing the subjects of interest is akin to knowing project role names—part of general awareness. Most people have a good scope of knowledge in the medical field. For some, it surpasses their understanding of entrepreneurship, engineering, and management. You know there are various types of doctors, and you can even guess their subjects of interest. For example, you can differentiate a general practitioner from a pediatrician and understand what an ENT specialist and a dentist are interested in. However, you might struggle to name even three roles within the categories of "engineers" or "managers" if you haven’t specifically focused on these. Therefore, after studying systems thinking, it is essential to also study systems management and systems engineering [ ^7 ].

A successful constructor needs to understand roles and interests in project activities far better than in any particular field. Our educational program is designed to cultivate a comprehensive view.

[ ^1 ]: International Standard ISO 42010 provides an approximate list of subjects of interest: functionality, attainability, usage, purpose of the system, system capabilities, system properties, known constraints, structure, behavior, efficiency/performance, resource utilization, reliability, security, integrity and information safety, complexity, ability to evolve, openness, parallel execution, autonomy, cost, schedule, service quality, usage flexibility, development flexibility, modifiability, modularity, management, interprocess communications, mutual blockages, state changes, subsystem integration, data availability, privacy, compliance with legislation, rationale, organizational goals and strategies, user experience, maintainability, cost-acceptability, and ease of decommissioning and disposal. Clearly, this list is not exhaustive; different systems may have other characteristics (subjects of interest).

[ ^2 ]: Executors of roles may vary, but this mental technique allows them to temporarily focus on what they share, specifically their interest in the price of a vehicle.

[ ^3 ]: The system as a "transparent box."

[ ^4 ]: More on this in the course "Systems Engineering."

[ ^5 ]: For example, an architect can propose various modularity-based solutions to accommodate these preferences: the more/less a certain subject of interest, the better. This becomes part of negotiation and compromise when satisfying the interests of project roles. Preference is often used synonymously with "role interest."

[ ^6 ]: A practices manager is interested in the methods and practices used in the enterprise. For instance, this role might be interested in which IT program is used in the automotive plant's design office: does it allow for 2D or 3D modeling?

[ ^7 ]: These are awareness-raising transdisciplines that will be beneficial to any specialist aiming for strong intelligence.
