List the five or more concepts from this section that stood out to you the most, and note next to them the concepts they are most connected with in your mind. These concepts can be from your current worldview, meaning you aren't limited to mentioning only the main concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with coursemates, colleagues, or close ones. For instance, try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your experience, link different concepts together, or explain their importance.

In the modeling workspace, locate the assignment by its number and complete all its components.
