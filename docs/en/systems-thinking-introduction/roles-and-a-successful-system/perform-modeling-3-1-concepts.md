# Perform Modeling: 3.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to each, indicate the concepts they are most strongly connected with for you. Other concepts may come from your current worldviews, meaning it's not necessary to list only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with peers, colleagues, or close ones. For example, try to explain these concepts in simple language, provide examples from your own experience, relate different concepts to each other, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.
