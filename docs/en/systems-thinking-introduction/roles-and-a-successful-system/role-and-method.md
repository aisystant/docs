When we examine project roles, we inevitably connect them with practices (methods). We will continue to use the terms method and practice as synonyms. In systems thinking, the term "method" does not carry the same meaning as it does in everyday language^[For example, when discussing the contrast between theory and practice.]. We need this concept to formally describe the actions of project roles. Project roles operate according to a method (practice), and each role can execute multiple methods, through which work artifacts are created. For instance, a swimmer can swim using various styles (often the word "style" is a synonym for method and practice, and sometimes it's referred to as a technique)â€”freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, etc.

There are methods for surgeons, dentists, entrepreneurs, engineers, marketers, and so forth. People learn applied methods (practices) to more effectively create work artifacts. Be sure to list the methods you consciously use and then note the work artifacts you produce with their help.

In your work, you apply various methods to create work artifacts. In doing so, you might be engaging in either analytical or engineering work. In the first case, you create internal work artifacts, meaning something for yourself. For instance, you may draft your plans, analyze completed work, or gather data. In the second case, you create external work artifacts that are delivered to others. In this scenario, unlike the first, you alter the surrounding world with your decisions.

Pay attention to how much time you spend as an analyst versus an engineer. In the evening, compile or recall a list of the external and internal work artifacts you have created^[For more information on how to enhance personal effectiveness, you can learn more in the "Practices of Self-Development" course.].
