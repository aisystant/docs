# Theater Metaphor

To understand what "role" means, let's turn to theater. We are all familiar with the phrase "All the world's a stage, and the people actors in it." This phrase not only holds philosophical recognition; it is also useful in systems thinking.

The theater metaphor helps explain the difference between an action and the performer of the action or between a role and the executor of the role [ ^1 ]. In theater, there is a distinction between Vladimir Vysotsky [ ^2 ] as a performer and the role he plays. Even children understand this. Yet, adults sometimes fail to realize that they themselves play the roles of "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, the same actor can play different roles, and any person’s actions can be viewed through the concept of "role." It's fair to say that everyone plays roles in their personal life or work projects. However, not everyone thinks about this consciously.

We pay attention to our actions deliberately only when we want to improve our behavior. If there is no need to change our thinking or work practices, then a role-based approach is unnecessary. However, if it's crucial to change the working principle of an individual or an entire team, using the concept of "role" and other related concepts—such as "method (practice)" and "work artifact"—is the best way to achieve it today.

In theater, role actions are clearly defined by the script, and the performers can change regularly. Life is much the same: different people can play the role of a surgeon. However, any surgeon operates based on a specific medical practice they learned at university. The concept of "role" is inseparably linked with the concept of "method (practice)": as soon as we shift to a role-based perspective, we must also discuss role practices [ ^3 ].

Thus, a role [ ^4 ] is a culturally established designation: surgeon, football player, driver, hammer [ ^5 ] or car, etc. A certain agent, whom we call the executor of the role, performs the role. From the theater metaphor and the human actor, we move to a more fundamental consideration, where role executors can be not only people but also other agents (such as artificial intelligence, a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a rock).

The actions of an agent in a role are role behaviors conducted according to specific rules or using a particular method (practice). Executors of roles create work artifacts through practices. Let's examine this further:

* The concept of a role isn't limited to people, even though we started understanding this concept through the theater metaphor;
* Roles are not something a person has, but something a person participates in within an activity (process) or as part of a system;
* The executor of a role isn't necessarily a person, hence we talk about an agent as the role executor or about an inanimate object;
* Agents can be both people and inanimate systems;
* The success of the system depends on roles and their interests;
* Roles execute the practice and create work artifacts.

[ ^1 ]: In this context, I am not a collection of roles. I am rather the executor of a specific role in a particular situation or project. However, I also possess the mastery to play many different roles.

[ ^2 ]: The role of Hamlet can be played by John Doe, whose performance might simply pale in comparison to V. Vysotsky's talent. However, both performers still play the role of Hamlet, even if they have different qualifications. Therefore, we will separately discuss roles and executors. The role remains the same, while executors may vary.

[ ^3 ]: As well as work artifacts, systems, and much more. Systems thinking introduces specific concepts and demonstrates how they are interconnected.

[ ^4 ]: The term "role" has synonyms such as role or functional object.

[ ^5 ]: Recall the consideration of a "hammer" from the previous section.
