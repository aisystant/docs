# Theatrical Metaphor

To understand what a "role" is, let's turn to the theater. Everyone knows the phrase, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." This phrase is not only a philosophical statement but also useful in systems thinking.

The theatrical metaphor helps explain the difference between action and the executor/performer of the action, or between the role and the role's executor/performer[ ^1 ]. In theater, we distinguish between the performer Vladimir Vysotsky [ ^2 ] and the role he plays. Even young children understand this. However, adults sometimes fail to recognize that they themselves play the roles of "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, the same actor can play different roles, and the actions of any person can be viewed through the lens of the "role" concept. One could say that everyone plays roles in their personal lives or work projects. Not everyone, however, reflects on this.

We consciously pay attention to our actions only when we aim to improve our behavior. If we don't need to change our thinking or work practices, there's no reason for a role-based perspective. Yet, if it's important for us to change the principle of operation of an individual or an entire team, the best option today is to use the concept of "role" and other related concepts such as "method (practice)" and "work artifact."

In theater, role actions are clearly defined by the script, while the performers can change regularly. Life is much the same: the role of a surgeon can be played by different people. However, any surgeon acts based on certain medical practices they studied at university. The concept of "role" is inherently linked to the concept of "method (practice)"; as soon as we shift to a role-based perspective, we must also discuss role practices[ ^3 ].

Thus, a role[ ^4 ] is a culturally established name: surgeon, soccer player, driver, hammer[ ^5 ], or car, etc. A specific agent, which we call the role's performer, executes the role. From the theatrical metaphor and the human actor, we shift to a more fundamental perspective, where role performers can be not only humans but also, for example, other agents (like artificial intelligence, a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a stone).

The actions of an agent by role constitute role behavior, carried out according to specific rules or with the aid of a particular method (practice). With practices, role performers create work artifacts. Let's further analyze the following:

* The concept of role applies not only to humans, although we began understanding it through a theatrical metaphor;
* Roles are not possessed by an individual; rather, an individual participates in some activity (process) or is part of a system through a role;
* The role performer is not necessarily human, which is why we refer to an agent as the role performer or an inanimate object;
* Agents can be both people and inanimate systems;
* The success of a system relies on roles and their interests;
* Roles execute practices and create work artifacts.

[ ^1 ]: Do not think of "I" as a collection of roles. "I" am the performer of a specific role in a particular situation or project, but I also have the skill to play many different roles.

[ ^2 ]: The role of Hamlet may be played by John Doe, whose performance pales next to the talent of V. Vysotsky. However, both performers still play the role of Hamlet, even though they have different qualifications. Therefore, we will speak separately about roles and performers. The role remains the same, yet the performers may differ.

[ ^3 ]: And also work artifacts, systems, and much more. Systems thinking introduces certain concepts and shows how they are interconnected.

[ ^4 ]: The concept of "role" has synonymsâ€”role entity or functional object.

[ ^5 ]: Recall the consideration of a "hammer" from the previous section.
