title: Theatrical Metaphor
---

To understand what a "role" is, let's turn to the theater. Everyone knows the phrase, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." This phrase not only carries philosophical weight but is also useful in systems thinking.

The theatrical metaphor helps explain the difference between an action and the executor of that action, or between a role and the performer of that role. In the theater, we distinguish between the performer Vladimir Vysotsky and the role he plays. This distinction is understood even by young children. However, adults sometimes fail to realize that they themselves perform roles such as "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, the same actor can play different roles, and one can view any person's actions through the lens of the "role" concept. It's apt to say that everyone plays roles in their personal lives or work projects, though not everyone is conscious of it.

We intentionally focus on our actions when we want to improve our behavior. If thereâ€™s no need to change our thinking or work practices, role consideration may seem unnecessary. However, to change the working principle of an individual or an entire team, the best approach today is to use the concept of a "role," along with related concepts like "method (practice)" and "work artifact."

In theater, actions per the role are clearly defined by the script, while performers can change regularly. The same applies to life: different people can play the role of a surgeon. Yet, any surgeon acts based on a certain medical practice studied in university. The concept of "role" is inseparably linked to "method (practice)": transitioning to role consideration requires discussing role practices.

Therefore, a "role" is an established cultural name: surgeon, soccer player, driver, hammer, or vehicle, etc. A role is enacted by a certain agent, which we call the performer of the role. Moving from the theatrical metaphor and human actor, we arrive at a more foundational examination where role performers may include not only humans but also other agents (like artificial intelligence, a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a stone).

Actions by the agent in a role are role behaviors executed according to certain rules or through certain methods (practices). Role performers use practices to create work artifacts. Let's delve deeper into the following:

* The concept of a role is not limited to humans, even though we started understanding it through the theatrical metaphor.
* Roles are not possessed by people; rather, people participate in activities (processes) or are part of a system through their roles.
* The performer of a role isn't necessarily a person; hence, we speak of an agent as the performer of a role or an inanimate object.
* Agents can include both people and inanimate systems.
* The success of a system depends on roles and their interests.
* Roles execute practices and produce work artifacts.
