### Understanding the Distinction Between Roles and Project Roles

A project role is always executed by a person or an agent—not a stone, which has no intention. The concept of "role" can be applied not only to agents. A role is a functional object, and its executor is a physical entity. This could be an agent or an inanimate object without intention.

Let's consider an example with a taxi. In a taxi, the role of the driver could be performed by a human or a robot equipped with artificial intelligence (a fine point, as soon we might refer to AI intentions). In the first case, we refer to it as a project role to emphasize human involvement. But when we say "there is a driver role in a taxi," it means the role's executor could either be a human or an inanimate object.

It's important to clearly understand the distinction between:

* **Physical Object:** This includes a human, AI, or another inanimate object. When we refer to a physical object, we highlight that it's something existing in the physical world. We aren't concerned with the specific role this physical object might play.^[A stone is just a stone. It's a typical physical object. Its function might not be clear. Yet, if someone needs to do something specific like driving nails or keeping papers from flying away, then we'll speak of functional objects—a hammer and a paperweight. Whether it’s a stone is less critical. The main point is that as a physical object, it exists in 4D (three-dimensional space and time).]

* **Functional Object:** This is the role itself. In the above example, it is the role of the driver. When discussing a functional object, we focus on the role itself rather than simply a physical object—that is, not just a human, but a driver with a certain skill set. Here, we care about the behavior of the functional object and not merely which physical object will assume this role.^[Merging the physical object with the functional will be necessary when creating a system, but we must be adept at distinctly focusing on these two entities and being able to discuss them separately.]

* **Role or Functional Behavior:** We assert that a functional object possesses certain role or functional behavior, viewing the system as a "black box."^[The internal design doesn’t concern us here. Details on the system's design as a “clear box” will be covered in Section 6 "Systems Modeling."] For the driver's role, this behavior is called driving the vehicle.

This division into physical object, functional object (role), and role behavior is an essential approach in systems thinking.

For example, initially, we identify the need for a nail-driving function. A function represents behavior. This function associates itself with the "nail driver" role, and then an executor is assigned to this role. It doesn't have to be a physical object like a hammer^[Remember, culturally, instead of “nail driver” people say “hammer.” The term "hammer" has become culturally conditioned and is as widely accepted as the term "driver." Certain terms are permanently attached to functional objects in culture. Instead of saying "car driver," you can simply say "driver." Likewise, instead of saying "nail driver," you can just say "hammer." A hammer is a functional object, while a physical object can be a stone, microscope, or hammer. Here, the hammer assumes the role of a specific tool as a physical object.], which I have in my garage. A microscope in the laboratory or a stone outside my window could fill the necessary "nail driver" role.^[This underscores specific objects—microscope and stone—rather than abstract examples.]

Engineers design systems similarly. They first determine what functions are needed, naming the system based on this function-behavior, thus providing it with a functional name or role. Next, they identify which modules or physical objects best suit these functional roles.

The role-based approach is the same for an agent or an "iron" inanimate system, assuming we're viewing them as role executors. We refer to the agent's behavior as role behavior, while calling the behavior of an "iron" system the system function. Nonetheless, discussing a car's role behavior isn’t incorrect.

However, deeper differences exist. For example, persuading a person to step into a desired role differs from a microscope assuming the role of a hammer.^[More accurately, all "persuasion" is prescribed by formal engineering methods. If calculations are correct, the iron system cannot escape fulfilling its prescribed role.] Thus, in systems with people, leadership practices take precedence. Leadership focuses on ensuring a person assumes a role at the right time and performs it well, effectively, and with satisfaction. A leader knows how to place a person in a role. The systems leadership method aids someone in adopting a specific role. Inanimate systems assume roles through conventional engineering methods based on physical theories.

For instance, a person in a managerial role might reprimand an employee for tasks left undone during a meeting, perfectly fitting within managerial practice. However, as a leader, this person might have an evening conversation to understand the employee's challenges better.

Another distinction is that an "iron" system has no role interest, which exists only for project roles. To create a successful system, one must first identify the interested project roles, then their role interests. Human behavior is driven by "intention," whereas a role is guided by "preference."
