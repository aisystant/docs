# Physical and Functional Objects

Let's understand the difference between a role and a project role.

A project role is always performed by a person or an agent, not an inanimate object like a stone, which has no intention. The term "role" can be used not only in relation to an agent. After all, a role is a functional object, and its performer is some kind of physical object. This object could be an agent or a non-agent without intention.

Let's consider an example with a taxi. In a taxi, the driver role can be performed by a human or a robot with artificial intelligence (a delicate matter here, as we may soon talk about AI intentions). In the first case, we refer to a project role to emphasize the human element. But when we say "there is a driver role in a taxi," we allow for that role to be filled by either a person or an inanimate object.

It is important to clearly understand the division into:

* **Physical object**: This can be a person, AI, or other inanimate objects. Note that when we speak about a physical object, we signify something that exists in the physical world. We know nothing about the role this physical object might play[^1]. Crucially, when we call it a physical object, we know it exists in the 4D dimension (three-dimensional space and time).
* **Functional object**: This is, in essence, the role. In the aforementioned example— the role of the driver. When we discuss a functional object, we focus on not just a physical object but a role. It’s not just a person but a driver with certain expertise. In this context, the behavior of this functional object matters, not which physical object performs this role[^2];
* **Role-based or functional behavior**: We refer to specific role-based or functional behaviors of a functional object, viewing the system as a "black box"[^3]. For instance, the driver's role has the behavior called driving a vehicle.

Such separation into physical objects, functional objects (roles), and role-based behavior is an important technique in systems thinking.

For instance, first, we understand that we need the function of hammering nails. Function equals behavior. This function ties to the role of the "nail-hammer," and only then is a performer assigned to this role. It doesn’t necessarily have to be the physical object like the hammer[^4] lying in my garage. The desired role of the "nail-hammer" could be filled by a microscope in the lab or the stone visible from my window[^5].

This is also how engineers design systems. First, they understand which functions are needed, and based on this function-behavior, name the system, providing it with a functional name or role. Only then do they determine the modules or physical objects best suited for these functional roles.

The role approach is the same for both an agent and a "mechanical" inanimate system if we examine them as performers of certain roles. In this case, an agent's behavior is referred to as role-based behavior, while the mechanical system's behavior is called the system's function. While it is possible to discuss the role-based behavior of a vehicle, it’s not incorrect.

However, more profound differences exist. For instance, a person assumes a necessary role through persuasion, while you don't need to persuade a microscope to take on the role of a hammer[^6]. Therefore, in systems involving people, leadership practices become paramount, focusing on encouraging people to assume and excel in their roles with enthusiasm. A leader knows how to place a person in a role. The systems leadership method is about helping another person assume a specific role. Conversely, placing "mechanical" systems into roles occurs through conventional engineering methods based on physical theories.

For example, a person in the role of a manager might deliver a reprimand to an employee for not completing an assignment during a meeting, all within managerial practice. However, the same person in the role of a leader might have a heartfelt conversation in the evening to understand the problems the employee faced.

Another difference lies in that a "mechanical" system has no role interest, which exists only for project roles. Successful system creation begins with identifying the relevant project roles and then discovering their role interests. A person's behavior is governed by the concept of "intention," while a role has "preference."

[^1]: A stone is just a stone. This is a typical physical object. Its function is not immediately clear. If someone wants to achieve something, then a specific function is required. For example, they need to hammer a nail or weigh down papers on a desk to prevent them from scattering. Then we talk about functional objects like a hammer and a paperweight. The fact that it's a stone becomes less important. 
[^2]: Combining a physical object with a functional one is necessary when creating a system, but we should be able to focus attention separately on these two entities and discuss them independently.
[^3]: Here, we are not concerned with the internal structure. The system structure (as a transparent box) will be explained in more detail in Section 6, "System Modeling."
[^4]: Remember that in culture instead of "nail-hammer," people say "hammer." The term "hammer" has become culturally established, akin to the term "driver." In culture, terms are continuously associated with functional objects. There's no need to say "someone who drives a car," simply say "driver." Similarly, there's no need to say "nail-hammer," just say "hammer." This implies that "hammer" is a functional object, while a physical object could be a stone, a microscope, or a hammer. Here, the hammer is understood as a specific tool as a physical object.
[^5]: It is deliberately emphasized that we are speaking about specific objects—the microscope and the stone—not about some abstract instances.
[^6]: More precisely, all "persuasions" are formalized in engineering methods. If calculations are correct, a mechanical system cannot escape executing the assigned role.
