# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

The concept of "role" helps humanity better describe the physical world and model human activities. "Role" is associated with action, while the agent is the executor of the role. Subsequently, one can separately discuss the mastery and qualifications of the executor, as well as specifically address and enhance the role-related actions necessary in a team.

It can be said that "role" is a cognitive model that helps study and improve an agent's behavior. Through the concepts of "role," "subject of interest," and "rolesâ€™ interests" (preferences), a successful system is determined.

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions regardless of who is currently fulfilling that role. This knowledge, along with tools, is what we call a method (practice). With specific methods (practices), roles create work artifacts.
