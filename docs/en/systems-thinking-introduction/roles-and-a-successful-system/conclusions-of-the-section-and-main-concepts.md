# Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

The concept of a "role" helps humanity better describe the physical world and model human activities. A "role" is associated with action, while an agent is the performer of that role. Further discussions can be focused on the thinking mastery and qualifications of the performer, as well as on improving the role-based actions necessary for a team.

We can say that a "role" is a thinking model that aids in studying and improving an agent's behavior. Terms like "role," "subject of interest," and "role interests" (preferences) help define a successful system.

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions irrespective of who performs the role at a given time. This accumulated knowledge, along with tools, is what we call a method (practice). Using specific methods (practices), roles produce work artifacts.
