# Perform the Modeling: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success

List at least 15 external roles of different people involved in your current project along with their interests. Keep in mind that one person can play multiple roles, so try to list all the roles of each individual. Assign your expectation (on a ten-point scale) for how well their preferences will be met by the end of the project. If necessary, make notes for further development. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can record a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for future reference.

Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its parts.
