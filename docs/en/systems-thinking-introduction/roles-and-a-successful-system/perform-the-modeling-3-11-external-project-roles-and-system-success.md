# Modeling Exercise: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success

List at least 15 external roles performed by different people in your current project along with their interests. Remember that one person may fulfill multiple roles, so try to list all the roles for each individual. Rate your expectation (on a ten-point scale) of how well their preferences will be met following project implementation. As needed, take notes for further exploration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for future reference.

Locate the corresponding task number in your modeling workspace and complete all its components.
