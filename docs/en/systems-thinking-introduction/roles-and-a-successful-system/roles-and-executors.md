# Roles and Executors

The concept of "role" was initially used to separate a person from their actions (role-based behavior). Now, we refer to agents^[Agents can be people or other entities that have intentions, strategies, and plans to achieve their goals. For instance, an organization of people with their tools and computers, and even some other entities we may not know yet. They can also play various roles in different projects and interact with other agents.] with intentions, meaning not necessarily humans, but also inanimate physical objects. There are many agents and objects, but far fewer roles.

Different concepts are associated with agents—such as dissatisfaction, intentions, qualifications, etc., while roles that agents play are linked to others—methods, subjects of interest, preferences, and more. However, we can also say that a "stone" can perform the role of a "hammer." There are specific nuances: agents have certain intentions and thus must decide themselves to perform a role^[Or do so through interaction with another agent, i.e., leadership methods place them in roles through another agent.], whereas a stone is placed in a role only by some agent. Moving forward, we will primarily consider the more complex case where the role executor is an agent^[When dealing with a physical inanimate object (non-agent), it's standard engineering.].

Although all people and other agents are different, most actions are similar and can be described and formalized as a method. Moreover, they can be improved and, importantly, taught to others. For example, surgeons are trained uniformly. In some cases, the role of a surgeon is already performed not by a human, but by artificial intelligence.

An average person at an enterprise rarely uses the theatrical metaphor. Generally, everyone sees their colleagues as executors, knowing them by first and last names. However, a system constructor understands not only this but also the roles each team member performs. This is an important system skill (technique) that should become a habit for you. Read the dialogue shown in the image^[It is taken from the textbook "Systems Thinking".].

In a project, you should see both the project roles and the names of the executors. Often, the same roles can be executed by several people, and one person can execute multiple roles. Although it's not common, the same person might play certain roles in one project and different roles in another. In each role, a person acts according to a specific method.

A person may not realize they are following any method if they haven't consciously studied it at university^[It's unlikely that a surgeon could specialize without conscious study of theory and practice at university, but many other roles and methods aren't studied consciously.]. Many teams always have autodidacts^[Most actions in life are performed without understanding the concept of a "method". For example, many people manage personal finances or swim but haven't formally learned it. However, in professional activities, it is impossible to become a professional without consciously studying modern methods. Without intelligence, it is impossible to navigate numerous applied methods and master them faster than others.]. However, there are few good autodidacts, with many more talented or ordinary individuals who have developed their abilities through the conscious study of methods and transdisciplinary skills from the intellect stack.

An executor of a role is characterized by their qualifications in a specific mastery. For example, how good a surgeon a person is. This qualification depends at the very least on the modernity of the studied theory (discipline) and the number of practical hours worked according to the role. Therefore, both contemporary theory and practical activity using the best technologies (tools) are required.
