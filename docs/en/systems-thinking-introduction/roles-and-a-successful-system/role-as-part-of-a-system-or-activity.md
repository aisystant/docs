# Role as a Part of a System or Activity

As you already know, the term “role” does not exclusively pertain to people. An executor of a role can be more than just a person—it could even be a “stone.” Now let's take it further and say that roles are not inherent to a person, as is commonly thought. In systems thinking, a role is viewed as a part of some system or activity.

A role is designated as a functional object. The concept of a “functional object” pertains to viewing a “system”: when we say [ ^1 ] that a system interests us as a functional object, it means we are interested not in its physical manifestation but in its role-based (or functional) behavior.

For example, we previously discussed the role of a hammer, and hence examined separately the physical object and the system, both called by one word—“hammer.” If we need to consider the role of “hammer,” it means there is a supersystem or a process where the function of driving nails is required.

Of course, we might examine a physical object (even a person) and discuss its potential to play certain roles. For instance, a stone could serve as a hammer or a paperweight, while a person might take on the role of a manager or a driver. However, we do not claim that the role of a hammer or a paperweight exists inside or is a part of the stone. Similarly, we do not assert that the role of a manager, driver, or father exists inside a person.

Whenever we talk about a role, we must consider, as the next step, what larger context this role should be examined in and what method it implements in order to produce a specific work artifact. And if we talk about a system (not a project), we can discuss role-based or functional breakdowns. For example, a driver is part of the “driver+vehicle” system.

We can evaluate a system from different perspectives, and one of these is functional or role-based. In it, we focus on the system as a functional object, meaning it performs a certain role. This is the primary view of the system as a “black box.” This approach shows that we are interested in the system's role-based behavior, not its internal workings.

Looking at a system as a “black box” projects its role-based (functional) behavior outward, whereas viewing it as a “transparent box” directs our attention toward how it is constructed internally. You will explore the concept of viewing systems as a “transparent box” in Section 6, “Systems Modeling.”

[ ^1 ]: When we manipulate words-concepts, we manage attention. Every concept highlights something specific. We cannot view the world entirely, and even understanding a system in full is challenging as we do not have the computational capacity. But we can focus on specific aspects within the whole system. For instance, a subject of interest is the cost. The concept of “subject of interest” links with the entire system, and by discussing one aspect, we maintain the connection with the whole.
