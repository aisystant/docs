title: Role as Part of a System or Activity
---

As you already know, the concept of "role" relates not only to people. A role can be performed not just by a human, but even by a "stone." Let's go further and say that roles are not inherently a part of a person, as is commonly thought. In systems thinking, a role is considered a part of a certain system or activity.

A role is identified as a functional object. The concept of "functional object" pertains to the examination of a "system": when we say^[When we operate with word-concepts, we direct attention. Each concept "highlights" something specific. We cannot consider the world in its entirety, and even a system is difficult to fully examine as we lack the computational power. However, we can focus on something specific within the entire system. For example, the subject of interest—cost. At the same time, the very concept of 'subject of interest' is connected to the whole system, and by discussing one part, we do not lose connection with the whole.] that a system interests us as a functional object, it means we are interested not in its physical embodiment but in the role (or functional) behavior of the system.

For example, we previously talked about the role of a hammer, and therefore examined separately the physical object and the system, both referred to with the same word—"hammer." If we need the role of a "hammer," it means there is a supersystem or a process where the function of driving nails is required.

Of course, we can consider a physical object (even a person) and discuss that it can play certain roles. For instance, a stone can play the role of a hammer or a paperweight, and a person can play the role of a manager or a driver. However, we don't say that the role of a hammer or a paperweight is inside or is part of a stone. Similarly, we wouldn't say that the role of a manager, driver, or father is inside a person.

Whenever we discuss a role, we must next consider what composition it is necessary to further examine this role in, and what method it implements to achieve a specific work artifact. If we are talking about a system (not a project), we can discuss role or functional breakdowns. For example, a driver is part of the "driver+vehicle" system.

We can examine a system from different perspectives, and one such perspective is functional or role-based. In this perspective, we focus on the system being a functional object, meaning it fulfills a certain role. This is the main consideration of the system as a "black box." This approach means that we are interested not in the structure of the system but in its role behavior.

A system as a "black box" presents role (functional) behavior externally, whereas a system as a "transparent box" directs our attention to its internal workings. You will become familiar with the examination of a system as a "transparent box" in section 6, "Systems Modeling."
