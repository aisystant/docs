# Role as Part of a System or Activity

As you already know, the concept of "role" is not exclusively linked to a person. A role can be performed by not only a person but even by a "stone." Moving forward, we say that roles are not inherent to people, as is commonly assumed. In systems thinking, a role is regarded as a part of some system or activity.

A role is designated as a functional object. The term "functional object" pertains to the examination of a "system": when we say [ ^1 ] that a particular system interests us as a functional object, it means we are interested not in the physical embodiment itself but in the role-based (or functional) behavior of the system.

For example, we previously discussed the role of a hammer, and thus considered separately the physical object and system both referred to as "hammer." If we require the role of a "hammer," it means there is a supersystem or some process that necessitates the function of driving nails.

Of course, we can consider a physical object (even a person) and say it can play specific roles. For instance, a stone can play the role of a hammer or paperweight, and a person can take on the role of a manager or driver. However, we do not say that the role of a hammer or paperweight is within or part of the stone. Similarly, we do not say that the role of a manager, driver, or father is within a person.

Whenever we talk about a role, we must consider the next step in understanding what it is part of, and which method it implements to produce a specific work artifact. If we are discussing a system (not a project), we can talk about role-based or functional decomposition. For example, a driver is part of the "driver+automobile" system.

We can discuss a system from various perspectives, one of which is functional or role-based. In this view, we focus on the system as a functional object performing a certain role. This is the primary way of considering the system as a "black box." Such an approach means we are interested not in the system's design, but in its role-based behavior.

The system as a "black box" exhibits role-based (functional) behavior outwardly, while the system as a "transparent box" draws our attention to its inner workings. You will learn about considering systems as "transparent boxes" in Section 6, "Systems Modeling."

[ ^1 ]: When operating with word-concepts, we manage attention. Each concept "highlights" a distinct feature. We cannot view the world in its entirety, and even examining a system in full is challenging due to limited computational power. However, we can focus on specific aspects of the system. For example, a subject of interestâ€”value. Though the concept of "subject of interest" ties to the whole system, discussing one aspect does not sever our connection to the whole.
