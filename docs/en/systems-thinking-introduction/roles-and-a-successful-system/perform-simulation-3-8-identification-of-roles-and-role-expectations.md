# Perform Simulation: 3.8. Identification of Roles and Role Expectations

Here is the translation in English:

Please review the example in the first row of the table. Notice that a well-crafted action statement suggests a role. Some roles are culturally conditioned, meaning they are widely used. Try to identify them by using resources such as ChatGPT or Google, or by discussing with familiar experts. Interview three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Remember, systems thinking is not just desk work; you'll need to communicate with various people! Don't put this off for the futureâ€”start today. For instance, write, call, or have a chat with colleagues over a cup of coffee. It is not allowed to write down information about your colleagues that you already know!

After that, fill in the row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Start describing your activities in some way, and then refine them. Write a draft about it in the AISYSTANT blog.

Find the corresponding modeling task in the workspace by its number and complete all its points.
