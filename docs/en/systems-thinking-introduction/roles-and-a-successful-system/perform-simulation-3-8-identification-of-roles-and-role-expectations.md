# Perform Modeling: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations

Please review the example in the first row of the table. Notice that a well-articulated action implies a role. Some roles are culturally conditioned, meaning they are widely used. Seek them out by utilizing tools like ChatGPT or Google or by consulting with familiar experts. Survey three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not a solitary endeavor; you will need to communicate extensively with different people! Don't postpone this task for the futureâ€”start today. For instance, reach out via message, call, or have a discussion over coffee with colleagues. Do not record information about colleagues that you already know!

Afterward, fill in a row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Begin by describing your activities in any manner, then refine your draft. Write a draft of this in a blog entry on Aisystant.

Locate the corresponding task number in your modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
