# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.5. Roles Performed by the Manager

Look at the example in the first row of the table. List at least three roles that you know your manager has performed in the past few months (if possible, arrange them by the time they were performed). Don't forget roles such as "strategist," "leader," "organizer," and other managerial and entrepreneurial roles as roles of organization engineers (technical engineers, unlike enterprise engineers, often don't consider this work, but it isâ€”it requires thinking mastery and a significant investment of time and other resources). If you lack the insight to pick the right words and labels (names), use tools like ChatGPT or Google, or consult with familiar experts.

Record the roles you perform in a managerial position in a professional or personal project. If you think you are not a manager anywhere, that is an obvious mistake. Use thinking through writing if necessary to reflect on this issue.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all of its components.
