# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success

List at least 15 external roles of different individuals in your current project along with their interests. Remember that a single person may assume multiple roles, so aim to document all roles for each individual. Indicate your expectation (on a scale of 1 to 10) for how well their preferences will be met upon project completion. If needed, jot down notes for further analysis. For example, in the "Notes" column, you might write a question to ask in a support chat or jot down a thought for future preparation.

Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.
