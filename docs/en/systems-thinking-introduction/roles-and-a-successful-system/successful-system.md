# Successful System

In modern systems thinking, the concept of a "successful system" is introduced through project roles, subjects of interest, and role interests.

A system is considered successful if it accounts for the role interests of all external and internal project roles. The project team identifies all interested project roles and tries to determine all possible subjects of interests. They then consider the preferences of the identified roles in the corresponding subjects of interest. After that, the team decides which project roles’ interests will be addressed during the creation of the system^[The project simultaneously considers several systems, which adds complexity—it's important not to get lost in the subjects of interest.].

The thinking technique involves considering (calculating) the maximum number of roles and their subjects of interest, but addressing only the role interests (preferences) of those roles chosen by the team. It is impossible to address all role interests due to time and resource constraints. However, by considering everything and addressing only the main subjects of interest and corresponding role interests, the team takes on the risk—understanding the potential costs involved. This is where transdisciplinary ethics becomes essential for the team^[The larger your market or the more complex the system, the greater the need for professional philosophers who practice applied ethics. For example, why it's necessary to consider the interests of environmentalists but not the workers' interests is discussed in more detail in the ethics course.].

For example, the team might consider a buyer’s role interest in a low price, but they are not obligated to meet this preference. After evaluating this role interest, the team might decide to set a price higher than the preference. By setting a certain price, the team might miscalculate and bear the responsibility in the form of lost profits or reduced market share. In such decisions, making a fatal mistake is unacceptable, although obvious mistakes are inevitable. An important technique here is the formulation of hypotheses and continuous development^[We apply the principle of incremental development (based on probing) instead of adhering to a predetermined lifecycle.].

Note that the team must not only choose which preferences to consider but also strive to identify all possible subjects of interest. These concerns extend beyond just financial considerations.

Notice that in your projects, subjects of interest like profit, timelines, and quality are predominantly discussed. This implies that certain project roles are defining their role interests^[They prefer higher profits, shorter timelines, and higher quality.]. From a systems thinking perspective, we cannot call a system successful if only these role interests are satisfied. If the system, for instance, poses a threat to human health, the company could suffer in the future.

Thus, the team first identifies all possible project roles and their subjects of interest. Then it considers each role interest and decides how to handle it: whether to address it or not? This is a conscious decision for which the team is responsible. The team places itself at risk by determining the list of project roles whose role interests will be addressed and ultimately satisfied in the system.

Some role interests may be chosen not to be addressed by the team. But if the team has evaluated all subjects of interest and preferences, they are accounted for. However, not all of them may be addressed. To consider and to address are different actions.

In the schema above, you see how systems thinking suggests achieving a successful system. Note that behind every word in this schema lies significant work. Throughout the course, we will discuss all these concepts and actions that project roles must undertake to achieve a successful system.
