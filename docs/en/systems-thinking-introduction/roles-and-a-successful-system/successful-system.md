# Successful System

In modern systems thinking, the concept of a "successful system" is introduced through project roles, subjects of interest, and role-based interests.

A system is considered successful if it accounts for the role-based interests of all external and internal project roles. The project team identifies all the stakeholder roles and attempts to determine all possible subjects of interest. They then consider the preferences of these roles in relation to the identified subjects of interest. Finally, the team decides whose role-based interests will be addressed during the creation of the system [ ^1 ].

The cognitive technique involves considering the maximum number of roles and their subjects of interest, but addressing the role-based interests (preferences) of only those roles selected by the team. It is impossible to satisfy every role-based interest due to limited time and resources. However, by considering everything and addressing only the key subjects of interest and corresponding role-based interests, the team is willing to "risk it" and acknowledge potential costs, understanding what expenses they may incur. This is why the team needs the transdiscipline of ethics [ ^2 ].

For instance, the team might consider a buyer's interest in a low price, but they are not obligated to satisfy this preference. After evaluating this role-based interest, the team might decide to set a price higher than the buyer's preference. By setting a specific price, the team might miscalculate and take responsibility in the form of lost profits or reduced market share. In such decisions, you can't make a fatal error, but obvious mistakes are inevitable. A crucial technique here is hypothesis formulation and continuous development [ ^3 ].

It's important to note that the team is obliged not only to choose which preferences to consider but also to aim to identify all possible subjects of interest, which are not solely financial.

Notice that in your projects, subjects of interest often discussed include profit, timelines, and quality. This means certain project roles have specified their role-based interests [ ^4 ]. From a systems thinking perspective, we cannot call a system successful if only these role-based interests are addressed. For instance, if a system could potentially harm human health, the company would face challenges in the future.

Thus, the team first identifies all possible project roles and their subjects of interest. They then consider each role-based interest and decide what to do with it: address it or not. It's a conscious decision for which the team assumes responsibility. The team puts their "skin in the game" when determining the list of project roles whose role-based interests will be addressed and ultimately satisfied in the system.

The team might decide not to address certain role-based interests. However, if the team has considered all subjects of interest and preferences, then they have been accounted for, though not all might be satisfied. To consider and to satisfy are two different things.

In the diagram above, you can see how systems thinking suggests achieving a successful system. Note that each word in this diagram represents significant work. Throughout the course, we will discuss all these concepts and actions that project roles must undertake to achieve a successful system.

[ ^1 ]: During the project, several systems are considered at once, adding complexity—it’s crucial not to get confused by the subjects of interest.

[ ^2 ]: And the larger your market or the more complex the system, the greater the need for professional philosophers practicing applied ethics. For example, why it's necessary to consider environmentalists' interests but not workers'. This is discussed further in the ethics course.

[ ^3 ]: We apply the principle of incremental development (based on exploration) rather than a predetermined, planned order following a specific life cycle.

[ ^4 ]: They prefer higher profits, shorter timelines, and better quality.
