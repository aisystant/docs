# Successful System

In modern systems thinking, the concept of a "successful system" is introduced through project roles, subjects of interest, and role interests.

A system is considered successful if it accounts for the role interests of all external and internal project roles. The project team identifies all interested project roles and strives to determine all possible subjects of interest. Next, they consider the preferences of the identified roles concerning relevant subjects of interest. The team then decides which project role interests will be addressed in the creation of the system [ ^1 ].

The thinking mastery involves accounting for (or identifying) the maximum number of roles and their subjects of interest, but only the role interests (preferences) of those roles chosen by the team are addressed. It is impossible to satisfy all role interests due to limited time and resources. However, by considering everything and only addressing the primary subjects of interest and corresponding role interests, the team "puts their skin in the game" and accepts the associated risks, understanding the potential costs. For this reason, the team needs the transdiscipline of ethics [ ^2 ].

For example, the team might consider the buyer's role interest in a low price, yet they are not obligated to meet this preference. They might decide to set the price above this preference after considering the role interest. By setting a particular price, the team might misjudge and suffer consequences such as lost profits or reduced market share. While it is critical to avoid fatal mistakes, some obvious mistakes are inevitable. An important approach here is hypothesis testing and continuous development [ ^3 ].

Note that the team is obligated not only to choose which preferences to consider but also to aim to identify all possible subjects of interest, which often extend beyond financial aspects.

In your projects, subjects of interest, such as profit, deadlines, and quality, are primarily discussed. This implies that certain project roles specify their role interests [ ^4 ]. From a systems thinking perspective, we cannot call a system successful if only these role interests are met. For instance, if a system poses a health risk, the company will face trouble in the future.

Therefore, the team first identifies all possible project roles and their subjects of interest. It then examines each role interest and decides whether to address it or not. This is a conscious decision, for which the team bears responsibility. The team "puts their skin in the game" when defining the list of project roles whose role interests will be considered and ultimately addressed in the system.

Some role interests may be decided not to be addressed by the team. However, if the team has considered all subjects of interest and preferences, they are accounted for, though not necessarily addressed. Considering and addressing are distinct actions.

The diagram above shows how systems thinking proposes achieving a successful system. Note that significant work stands behind each term in this diagram. In the course, we will discuss all these concepts and actions that project roles must undertake to achieve a successful system.

[ ^1 ]: During the project, multiple systems are considered, which adds complexity â€” it's essential not to get tangled in the various subjects of interest.

[ ^2 ]: The larger your market or the more complex the system, the greater the need for professional philosophers who practice applied ethics. For instance, why should environmental interests be considered but not workers' interests? This is explained in more detail in the ethics course.

[ ^3 ]: We apply the principle of incremental development (based on searching) instead of following a pre-defined life cycle.

[ ^4 ]: They prefer higher profits, shorter deadlines, and better quality.
