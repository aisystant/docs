# The Role as a Model of Thinking

An ordinary person often acts intuitively or based on experience, and their role-based behavior is conditioned by the theory previously instilled in them [ ^1 ]. Often, we say that a person acts according to their worldviews.

A worldview can be shaped by scientific theory or an old wives' tale. Scientific theories and disciplines provide a better description of role-based behavior, but non-scientific worldviews are simpler and therefore more appealing to most people. When we talk about an engineer's worldview, we primarily mean the engineering methods they learned in college and further developed in their professional work.

A conscious way to study professional roles involves setting up appropriate practices. One might say that a person instills discipline in themselves and masters the skill of handling tools (technologies). For instance, a driver learns traffic regulations and practices driving a car. The regulations are the theory (discipline), and the car is the tool. After mastering this, it can be said that the person has acquired the role of a driver, meaning they have studied the practice of "driving a car," resulting in the work artifact of a moved physical object (people, goods).

This thinking technique is applicable to all actions performed by individuals not only at work but also in their personal lives. For example, roles such as son, educator, learner, motivator, dishwasher, room cleaner, metro passenger, etc., can be highlighted. These roles are considered just like professional roles, focusing on methods (theories, technologies, and work artifacts).

Role-based consideration allows for special or formal attention [ ^2 ] to one's behavior. For example, when learning to swim, we understand that we need to master the technique (method, practice) of freestyle, enabling us to professionally execute the role of a freestyle swimmer [ ^3 ]. In critical situations involving child-rearing, one should avoid relying on poor automatism and anxious reactions and instead remember the role of an educator to seek and apply an appropriate method in communicating with the child.

When embarking on your studies, it is beneficial to understand the practices of a learner or what it means to have the skill to learn. The concept of "role" allows unconscious action to become conscious, focusing attention on formal objects (method, system, other roles, etc.). Typically, people learn unconsciously, unable to name the formal methods of learning (practices), meaning how or through which practices they learn.

Reflect on the methods through which you learn. For instance, why did the first homework task in the course mention systematic reading and information consumption control, the Pomodoro method, and investing time, thinking through writing, and thinking by speaking? These were listed as the primary practices for the role of a learner [ ^4 ].

However, we don't always need to approach our actions consciously and formally. Behavioral automatisms save attention, which is why some roles are performed unconsciously. For example, when brushing teeth or taking a shower. If there's no desire to change behavior or the world around us, there’s no need to burden ourselves with role-based consideration. But if there's a need to establish or alter the tooth-brushing process, we should consciously highlight the role of the tooth-cleaner, find the best oral hygiene method, then explore and master the tools - the toothbrush, paste, mouthwash, irrigator, and ultimately bring this role behavior to automatism.

Changing one's behavior is literally a change in thinking (mastering new techniques), necessitating attention to our actions. The concept of "role" as a model of thinking facilitates this, while thinking mastery helps quickly identify and implement the necessary applied practice.

It is crucial to understand that behind every project role stands a method (practice) and a work artifact. By naming a person according to their role, we simultaneously define a whole class of practices through which the role creates work artifacts. For example, for the role of a swimmer, we immediately identify a possible class of practices—freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, and when discussing an entrepreneur, we refer to other practices—Business Model Canvas, Lean Startup, Lean Canvas, and others. Hopefully, you understand that each role has a broad array of practices: unique ones for a surgeon, operational manager, financier, engineer, architect, educator, and so on.

In ancient times, masters simply did their work and rarely considered the strict formalization of their actions. Nonetheless, unique historical objects were created. However, the complexity of today's world is entirely different, but through the formalization of methods, more people can become masters of their craft, and humanity, on the whole, can create many successful systems.

Without role-based consideration, it is impossible to handle the complexity of the current stage of human development. A modern person will always be in demand if they continually learn and timely retrain. Systems thinking is a way to formalize the actions and behavior of numerous interested parties. The concept of "role" is the main concept for such formalization.

[ ^1 ]: A person may unknowingly absorb theory through interaction with others. Often, individuals learn unconsciously, absorbing information from the environment or emulating someone they see as an authority.

[ ^2 ]: This means highlighting the theory with its concepts, principles, etc.

[ ^3 ]: Note that the text deliberately places the concepts "role," "method," and "role-based behavior" side by side. You need to train your brain to differentiate these concepts, just as you distinguish other classes of concepts. For example, you don't confuse furniture and colors. You can separately discuss chairs, tables, and wardrobes, and also discuss their colors, sizes, etc. Such a type classifier/cognitive type machine is developed throughout one's life, but specialized training can significantly speed up this process. Both "flight hours" and quality training (which reduces the required time) are important. For more details on the type classifier, read the textbook "Systems Thinking."
