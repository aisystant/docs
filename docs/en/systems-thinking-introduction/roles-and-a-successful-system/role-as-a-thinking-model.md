title: Role as a Thinking Model
---

An ordinary person acts intuitively or based on experience, and their role behavior is determined by the theory previously instilled in them^[A person can subconsciously absorb theory from interactions with others. Often, people learn subconsciously, absorbing information from their surroundings or emulating someone they regard as an authority.]. We often say that a person acts according to their worldviews.

A worldview can be shaped by scientific theory or a grandmother's superstition. Scientific theories and disciplines better describe role behavior, but unscientific worldviews are simpler and therefore more popular with most people. When we talk about an engineer's worldview, we primarily refer to the engineering methods they learned in university and further developed through their work in the field.

A conscious approach to learning professional roles involves implementing appropriate practices. One might say that a person instills discipline in themselves and masters the use of tools (technologies). For example, a driver learns the rules of the road and practices driving a vehicle. The rules represent theory (discipline), and the car serves as the tool. Afterward, we can say that the person has mastered the role of the driver, meaning they have studied the practice of "driving a vehicle," through which they achieve the work artifact of a moved physical object (people, goods).

This thinking approach applies to all activities a person undertakes, not only professionally but also in personal life. For example, we can identify roles such as son, teacher, student, motivator, dishwasher, room cleaner, subway passenger, and so on. We examine these just like professional roles, focusing on methods (theories, technologies, and work artifacts).

Considering roles allows special or formal attention^[This means highlighting the theory with its concepts, principles, etc.] to one's behavior. For instance, when learning to swim, we understand that we need to master the technique (method, practice) of freestyle to professionally perform the role of a freestyle swimmer^[Note that the text specifically uses the concepts of "role," "method," and "role behavior" together. You need to train your mind to distinguish these concepts—just as you differentiate other classes of concepts. For example, you don't confuse furniture and colors. You can separately discuss chairs, tables, and cabinets, as well as their colors, sizes, etc. Such a type classifier/cognitive type machine is developed throughout a person's life, but specialized training can significantly accelerate this process. Both "hours in the air" and quality learning (which reduces the required time) are important. For more on the type classifier, refer to the textbook "Systems Thinking."]. In critical parenting situations, it's important not to follow poor automatic behaviors and become anxious, but rather, recall the role of the educator and seek a good method to apply in communication with the child.

When embarking on learning, it helps to understand what practices of a student exist or what the ability to learn entails. The concept of "role" allows unconscious action to become conscious, meaning focusing on formal objects of attention (method, systems, other roles, etc.). People usually learn unconsciously and can't name formal learning methods (practices), such as how or with what practices they learn.

Think about what methods you use to learn. For example, why does the first homework assignment in the course address systematic reading and information intake control, the Pomodoro method and time investment, thinking through writing, and thinking by speaking? These were listed as the main practices of the student's role^[All of these are detailed in the course "Practices of Self-Development."].

However, we don't always need to be conscious and approach our actions formally. Behavior automatisms save attention, so we perform some roles unconsciously. For example, when brushing our teeth or taking a shower. If we aren't looking to change our behavior or the world around us, we can avoid the effort of role consideration. But if we need to establish or alter the tooth-brushing process, we should consciously identify the role of "tooth cleaner" and find the best method for oral hygiene. We then delve into mastering the tools—toothbrush, toothpaste, rinse, irrigator. Afterward, we refine this role behavior to automatism.

Changing one's behavior is literally changing one's thinking (mastering new techniques), and for this, we need to pay attention to our actions. The "role" concept as a thinking model provides the opportunity to do this, while thinking mastery helps to find and quickly establish the necessary applied practice.

It's important to understand that each project role is linked to a method (practice) and a work artifact. By naming someone by their role, we simultaneously define an entire class of practices with which the role creates work artifacts. For example, for the role of a swimmer, we immediately determine possible classes of practices—freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly—and when talking about an entrepreneur, we consider other practices—Business Model Canvas, Lean Startup, Lean Canvas, and others. I hope you already understand that each role has numerous practices: specific to surgeons, operational managers, financiers, engineers, architects, educators, and so on.

In ancient times, masters simply did their work, rarely contemplating the strict formalization of their actions. Nonetheless, unique historical objects were created. However, the complexity of the modern world is entirely different, and through the formalization of work methods, a greater number of people can become masters of their craft and, overall, humanity can create a large number of successful systems.

Without role consideration, it is impossible to cope with the complexity of humanity's current development stage. A modern person will always be in demand if they continuously learn and timely relearn. Systems thinking is a way to formalize the actions and behaviors of numerous interested people. The concept of "role" is the main concept for such formalization.
