# Position, Successful System, and Intellect

Alongside the concept of a role, terms like position, rank, and qualification are used. They help describe human activities in the best possible way.

Qualification and rank are characteristics of the executor's role. Qualification indicates the level of mastery a person has in performing a certain role. This evaluation is provided by an organization, community, or government. A rank is assigned by competent bodies and reflects a person's position within a certain hierarchy established by these entities. For example, in science, the military, computer games, etc. At AISYSTANT, there is also a qualification system[^1] with 8 qualification levels.

A position defines the ability and obligation to perform certain roles, as well as the authorities over resource management (money, time of the executors). For instance, job descriptions outline obligations that can be understood as commitments to play certain roles and the possibility to play others. Additionally, HR documents and position-specific documents clarify which financial, material, and human resources a person in a certain position may manage. An individual is appointed to a position, and they sign relevant documents concerning their rights and obligations. For example, being appointed as the head of an enterprise.

A layperson might say that after appointment to a position, a person is required to adhere to job descriptions. From a systems thinking perspective, one can say that in a position, a person has the ability and obligation to perform appropriate roles and manage specific resources.

The head of an enterprise is a position that obliges a person, at the very least, to play the roles of manager and leader. They are responsible for the enterprise's resources and have the ability to perform any role within their enterprise. Who could forbid them?[^2]

Thus, one can view an enterprise employee from several perspectives:

* Functional view — role, role actions, methods;
* Organizational view — position, subordination and leadership, resource management, organization and execution of work.

A person-agent in a position[^3] with certain resources (financial, technological, etc.) is the minimal organizational unit. Organizational units also include divisions: departments, enterprises, holding companies.

When designing organizations, they designate organizational places: positions and slots in staffing tables (organizational charts), vacancies, and so on. In this way, one can see the structure of subordination of one organizational place to another. When a person-agent occupies an organizational place, an organizational unit emerges. An organization is a structured group of people who understand their authorities, subordination, roles, and responsibility for resources.

[^2]: Some managers make use of this ability, concentrating all decision-making on themselves. This way, they play all roles, while employees only prepare documents but do not make decisions based on their professional role, not 'putting their skin in the game.' Imagine a surgeon who, during an operation, goes to the chief physician to get approval for where to make an incision.
