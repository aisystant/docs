In addition to the concept of a role, terms such as position, rank, and qualification are also used. These terms help describe human activities in a more precise manner.

Qualification and rank are characteristics of a performer's role. Qualification indicates a person's level of skill in performing a particular role. This evaluation is provided by an organization, community, or state. Rank is granted by competent authorities and reflects the individual's position within a specific hierarchy established by these authorities, such as in science, the military, or computer games. At **Aisystant**, there are also specific qualifications and eight qualification levels.

A position defines the ability and responsibility to play certain roles and sets the authorities regarding the allocation of resources (money, performers' time). For example, job descriptions include duties that can be understood as obligations to perform certain roles and the possibility to play others. HR and position-specific documents also determine what financial, material, and human resources a person in a particular position can manage. An individual is appointed to a position and signs the relevant documents regarding their rights and responsibilities. For instance, someone might be appointed to the position of enterprise manager.

A layperson might say that once appointed to a position, a person is obligated to adhere to the job descriptions. From a systems thinking perspective, however, it's more about having the opportunity and obligation to fulfill corresponding roles and manage certain resources.

An enterprise manager is a position that requires a person to play the roles of manager and leader, at a minimum. They are responsible for the enterprise's resources and have the opportunity to play any role within their enterprise. After all, who can forbid them?^[Some managers take advantage of this opportunity, centralizing all decision-making to themselves. Consequently, they play all the roles, leaving employees only to prepare documents without making decisions in their professional roles, not putting their 'skin in the game.' Imagine a surgeon needing to run to the chief physician during surgery to approve where to make an incision.]

Thus, an enterprise employee can be viewed from several perspectives:

* **Functional perspective** – role, role-related actions, methods;
* **Organizational perspective** – position, subordination and leadership, resource management, organization and execution of work.

A person-agent in a position^[And, accordingly, having the right and/or obligation to perform certain roles.] with specific resources (financial, technological, etc.) constitutes a minimal organizational unit. Departments, divisions, and holding enterprises are also organizational units.

When organizations are designed, they identify organizational spots: positions and standings in the staffing schedule (in organizational charts), vacancies, etc. This approach reveals the structure of authority of some organizational spots over others. When a person-agent occupies an organizational spot, an organizational unit is formed. An organization is a structured group of people who understand their authorities, subordination, roles, and responsibility for resources.
