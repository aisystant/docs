# Position, Successful System, and Intellect

Alongside the concept of a role, terms like position, title, and qualification are used. These help in better describing human activities.

**Qualification** and **title** are characteristics of the executor/performer of a role. Qualification indicates the level of mastery a person has in performing a specific role. This assessment is given by an organization, community, or government. A title is assigned by competent authorities and reflects a person's status in a certain hierarchy established by these authorities, such as in science, the military, or video games. At Aisystant, there is also a system of qualification^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>] with eight levels of qualification.

A **position** defines the capability and obligation to play certain roles and also sets the authorities over resource management (money, performers' time). For example, job descriptions list duties that can be understood as obligations to play certain roles and the opportunity to play others. HR documents and position-specific documents also determine which financial, material, and human resources a person in a particular position can manage. An individual is appointed to a position and signs the corresponding documents regarding their rights and obligations. For instance, someone might be appointed as the head of an enterprise.

A layperson might say that after being appointed to a position, someone is obligated to follow the job descriptions, whereas from a systems thinking perspective, a person in a position has the opportunity and obligation to play corresponding roles and manage certain resources.

The head of an enterprise is a position that requires a person, at a minimum, to play the roles of manager and leader. They are responsible for the enterprise's resources and have the opportunity to play any role within their enterprise. Who can forbid them?^[Some leaders take advantage of this opportunity, concentrating all decision-making on themselves. As a result, they play all the roles themselves, while staff only prepare documents without making decisions related to their professional roles—essentially not putting their "skin in the game." Imagine a surgeon who, during an operation, goes to the chief doctor to approve where to make an incision.]

Thus, an employee of an enterprise can be viewed from several perspectives:

* **Functional consideration** — role, role actions, methods;
* **Organizational consideration** — position, subordination and leadership, resource management, organization, and execution of work.

A person-agent in a position^[And accordingly having the right and/or obligation to perform certain roles.] with certain resources (financial, technological, etc.) is the minimal organizational unit. Organizational units also include divisions such as departments, branches, and enterprises of a holding.

When designing organizations, organizational spots are identified: positions and roles in the staffing schedule (in organigrams), vacancies, etc. In this way, one can see the structure of subordination of some organizational spots to others. When a person-agent takes a position, an organizational unit is formed. An organization is a structured group of people who understand their authorities, subordination, roles, and responsibility for resources.
