# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.4. External and Internal Roles in the Project

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples.

Provide examples from both your work and personal projects. Describe the external and internal roles in your projects, making sure to include those roles that use or interact with your organization's product. Don't forget to mention the roles you personally perform. As needed, create notes for further development. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section, and later compile them to send to us at support@system-school.ru. We appreciate any feedback you provide.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
