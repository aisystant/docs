# Complete the modeling exercise: 3.1. Concepts

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to each, indicate the concepts they are most strongly connected with for you. Other concepts can be from your current worldview, meaning it is not necessary to only include the primary concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For example, try explaining these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts together, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
