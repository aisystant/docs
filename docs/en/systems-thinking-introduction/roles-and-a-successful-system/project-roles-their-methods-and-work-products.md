# Project Roles, Their Methods, and Work Artifacts

The term "role" is more commonly used in professional activities than in personal life [^1]. In this context, we primarily discuss project activities, hence the use of the term "project role." A project role is one performed by an agent (a person or any other agent with intentions) in a project [^2]. Alternatively, it is performed by an agent who somehow influences or is connected to the system being created in the project. It can be said that project roles are concerned with something. They have a specific subject of interest in the system.

In systems thinking, project roles are classified as external and internal.

Internal or team project roles refer to roles performed by members of the project team and all co-performers [^3]. All roles execute corresponding methods and produce specific work artifacts. For example, suppliers of components engage in the practice of supply, resulting in the appearance of components in the warehouse. All internal project roles belong to the extended enterprise, meaning these roles are involved in designing, creating, operating, maintaining, and ultimately decommissioning the system.

With respect to the automotive system, internal project roles include the plant manager, design engineer, assembly line worker, service station specialist, marketers, repair technicians, designers, testers, component suppliers, decommissioners, etc. They all follow a specific method (practice) and generate their work artifacts. The executors of these roles are team members who engage with the automotive system at all stages—from conception to decommissioning.

External project roles are those that interact with the finished system. These roles may be part of the supersystem, metasystem, or environment. This means that roles influence the system, or the system influences these roles. They also perform practices and have their work artifacts [^4]. For example, regarding the automotive system, external project roles include the driver, passenger, pedestrian, and environmentalist, among many others. Other external roles might include customers, competitors, tax officials, hackers, thieves, etc. It is important to distinguish clients into several roles specific to each system and/or field of activity. For example, a client [^5] might be a payer, operator, unpacker, and so forth. Try identifying the methods and work artifacts of these roles.

A person [^6] in a project role makes appropriate decisions and is accountable for them. Or, as they say, they put their "skin in the game." The consequences of these decisions lead to changes in project activities, meaning how the project role changes the world [^7].

Actions that do not result in changes in the physical world are not considered actions of a project role. One cannot say a person plays a role if they do not produce formal work artifacts for which they are responsible (e.g., by signing or otherwise putting their skin in the game). If a person fully carries out a practice resulting in a work artifact, such as a balance sheet with their signature, they are said to play the role of an accountant. The presence of a work artifact approved by a project role inevitably changes the physical world [^8].

[^1]: Nonetheless, all discussions apply to personal projects.
[^2]: If the executor is an inanimate object, we wouldn't refer to it as a "project role," but simply as a "role."
[^3]: Project team members and co-performers—those who are also agents.
[^4]: It is not recommended to name them with generic terms such as "client" or "user." Instead, name them based on the roles they identify themselves with, which clarifies their methods. For example, if we sell cars, the external project role would not be a client but a driver or owner.
[^5]: For any system, you can identify a client, so to specify actions more accurately, it is necessary to define the role more precisely. Do not merely mention "client" as a common term for all systems. Behind the "client" are numerous specific roles to consider when working with the system.
[^6]: Do not confuse the description, the driver's role, and a user profile, which is often used in marketing. The latter describes the person executing the role.
[^7]: For more on this, see the section "Roles of Analysts and Engineers: Positions" in the "Systems Thinking" textbook.
[^8]: At the very least, taxes will be paid.
