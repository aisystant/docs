# Project Roles, Their Methods, and Work Artifacts

The term "role" is more frequently used in professional settings than in personal life [ ^1 ]. In workplaces, it mostly pertains to project-related activities, which is why the concept of a project role is utilized. A project role refers to the role performed by an agent (a person or any other intentional agent) within a specific project [ ^2 ]. Alternatively, it is a role performed by an agent that in some way influences or is connected with the system being created within the project. Project roles are considered to be concerned with specific subjects of interest related to the system.

In systems thinking, project roles are classified as either external or internal.

Internal or team project roles refer to the roles performed by members of a project team and all co-performers [ ^3 ]. All roles execute their respective methods and yield specific work artifacts. For example, component suppliers engage in the practice of supply, resulting in the availability of components in the warehouse. All internal project roles are part of an extended enterprise, meaning these roles conceive, create, and maintain the operation of the system—repair, service, and ultimately dispose of it.

Regarding the automotive system, internal project roles include the plant manager, design engineer, assembly line worker, service station technician, marketers, repair staff, designers, testers, component suppliers, disassembly specialists, and so forth. All these roles adhere to specific methods (practices), producing their own work artifacts. At the same time, the performers of these roles are members of a large team working with the automotive system at every stage—from conception to disposal.

External project roles are considered those that interact with the finished system. These external project roles may be part of the supersystem, the extended supersystem, or the environment. This means that the roles either influence the system or are influenced by it. They too carry out practices and have their own work artifacts [ ^4 ]. For example, concerning the automotive system, external project roles include drivers, passengers, pedestrians, environmentalists, and many others. Additional external project roles might include clients, competitors, tax officials, hackers, thieves, etc. Clients of the system need to be divided into several roles that are specific to each system and field of activity. For example, a client [ ^5 ] could be a payer, operator, unpacker, and so forth. Try to identify the methods and work artifacts of these roles.

A person [ ^6 ] in a project role makes appropriate decisions and takes responsibility for them. Or, as the saying goes, they put their "skin in the game." The consequences of these decisions lead to changes in project activities, which is how a project role changes the world [ ^7 ].

Actions by individuals that do not result in changes in the physical world are not considered actions of a project role. One cannot say a person plays a role if they do not produce formal work artifacts for which they are accountable (for example, by signing or otherwise putting their skin in the game). If a person fully executes a practice that results in a work artifact, such as a financial statement with their signature, then it can be said that they are playing the role of an accountant. The emergence of a work artifact approved by a project role inevitably changes the physical world [ ^8 ].

[ ^1 ]: Nonetheless, all considerations apply to personal projects.

[ ^2 ]: If the executor is an inanimate object, we will not use the term "project role" but simply "role."

[ ^3 ]: Members of a project team and co-performers are those who are also agents.

[ ^4 ]: It is not recommended to label them generally as "client" or "user"; it is better to name them by the roles they themselves identify with, which will also clarify their methods. For example, if we sell cars, an external project role would not be a client, but a driver or owner.

[ ^5 ]: For any system, one can identify a client, so to describe their actions more accurately, it is necessary to define the role more specifically, rather than stopping at the common mention of the word "client." Behind "client" lies a multitude of specific roles one must keep in mind when working with a system.

[ ^6 ]: Do not confuse the description, the role of a driver, and the user profile often used in marketing. The latter describes the executor of the role (the person).

[ ^7 ]: More details on this can be found in the section "Roles of Analysts and Engineers. Positions" of the textbook "Systems Thinking."

[ ^8 ]: At the very least, taxes will be paid.
