# Project Roles, Their Methods, and Work Products

The concept of "role" is more frequently utilized in professional activities than in personal life[^1^]. In the workplace, it predominantly refers to project activities, thus the term project role is used. A project role is the role that an agent (a person or any other agent with intentions) performs in a particular project[^2^]. Alternatively, it is executed by an agent that somehow influences or is connected with the system being created in the project. It can be said that project roles have specific concerns. They have a certain subject of interest in the system.

In systems thinking, external and internal project roles are distinguished.

Internal or team project roles are those performed by project team members and all collaborators[^3^]. These roles execute corresponding methods and produce specific work artifacts. For instance, component suppliers engage in the practice of supply, resulting in components arriving at the warehouse. All internal project roles are part of the extended enterprise, meaning these roles conceive, create, and support the system's operation—they repair and maintain, as well as dispose of it.

Regarding the automotive system, internal project roles include the factory manager, design engineer, assembly line worker, service station specialist, marketers, repairers, designers, testers, component suppliers, and dismantlers, among others. They all work according to a specific method (practice) and create their work artifacts. The executors of these roles are part of a large team that engages with the automotive system at all stages—from conception to dismantling.

External project roles are considered those that interact with the completed system. These external project roles may be part of the supersystem, even beyond that, or the broader environment. This implies that the roles influence the system or the system influences these project roles. They also execute practices and have their work artifacts[^4^]. For example, concerning the automotive system, external project roles include the driver, passenger, pedestrian, environmental advocate, and many others. Additional external project roles might include client, competitor, tax official, hacker, thief, etc. Clients of the system should be divided into several roles specific to each system and/or field of activity. For instance, a client[^5^] could be a payer, operator, unpacker, etc. Try to identify the methods and work artifacts for these roles.

A person[^6^] in a project role makes corresponding decisions and takes responsibility for them. Or, as it's said, they put their "skin in the game." The outcomes of these decisions become changes in project activities, which is how a project role transforms the world[^7^].

Actions of an individual that do not lead to changes in the physical world are not considered actions of a project role. One cannot say a person plays a role if they do not create formal work artifacts for which they are accountable (for instance, by signing or otherwise putting their skin in the game). If a person fully executes a practice resulting in a work artifact, such as a signed balance sheet, then we can say they perform the role of an accountant. The appearance of an approved work artifact by the project role inevitably changes the physical world[^8^].

[^1^]: However, all these reflections are applicable to personal projects.
[^2^]: If the executor is an inanimate object, we will not use the term "project role" but will simply say "role."
[^3^]: Project team members and collaborators—those who are also agents.
[^4^]: It is not recommended to call them generic terms like "client" or "user"; it's better to refer to them by the roles they identify with, as this will clarify their methods. For example, if we sell cars, an external project role would be not the client, but the driver or owner.
[^5^]: For any system, a client can be identified; hence, to describe their actions more precisely, it is necessary to define the role more specifically rather than stopping at the general mention of the term "client," which is common to all systems.
[^6^]: Do not confuse the description with the role of a driver and the user persona, often used in marketing. The latter describes the role-implementing person.

[^8^]: At the very least, taxes will be paid.
