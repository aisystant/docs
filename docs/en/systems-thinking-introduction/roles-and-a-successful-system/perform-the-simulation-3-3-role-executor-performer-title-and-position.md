# Complete the modeling exercise: 3.3. Role, Executor/Performer, Title, and Position

Review the example in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the differences between the concepts of "role" and "position," "title" and "qualification." Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Recall the full names of people you know who fit these descriptions. If you lack the perspective to select the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with familiar experts. Describe your colleagues from work and personal projects.

If necessary, make notes upon re-filling the template tables. You can record your reflection and the results of your work on obvious mistakes.

Find the corresponding task number in your workspace for modeling and complete all its points.
