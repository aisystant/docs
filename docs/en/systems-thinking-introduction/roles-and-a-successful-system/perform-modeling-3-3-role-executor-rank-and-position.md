# Execute Modeling: 3.3. Role, Performer, Title, and Position

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the differences between the concepts of "role" and "position," "title" and "qualification." Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Recall the full names of people you are familiar with who fit these descriptions. If your personal knowledge and perspective are insufficient, use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts. Describe your colleagues from work and personal projects.

As needed, take notes when filling out the template tables again. You can record your reflection and the results of your work on correcting mistakes.
