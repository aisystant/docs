# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Notice that a well-formulated description of an activity often suggests a role. Some roles are culturally determined, meaning they are widely recognized. Try to identify these roles—use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts. Survey three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not a desk job; you will need to communicate with many different people! Don’t put this off—start today. For example, write a message, make a call, or have a conversation with your colleagues over a cup of coffee. You are not allowed to record information about colleagues that you already know!

After that, fill in the row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Start describing your activities in any way you can, and then revise them. Write a draft about this in your AISYSTANT blog.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
