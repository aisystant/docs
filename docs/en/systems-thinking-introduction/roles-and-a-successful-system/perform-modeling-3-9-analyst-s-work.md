# Perform Modeling: 3.9. The Work of an Analyst

Recall how an analyst differs from an engineer. Fill in the percentage of time you spend on analytical work versus the percentage of time on engineering work:

* Doing something that does not lead to your decisions being accepted by others without additional questions — creating internal work artifacts;
* Changing the surrounding world with your decisions, where everyone understands that these are your decisions, your responsibility, and they do not interfere — creating external work artifacts.

Record these numbers in a table: ideally, extract these numbers from your Pomodoro exocortex. You can separately divide work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
