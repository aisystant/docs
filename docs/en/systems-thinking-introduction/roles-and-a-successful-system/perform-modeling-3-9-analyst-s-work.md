# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.9. Work of an Analyst

Reflect on how an analyst differs from an engineer. Write down the percentage of time you spend on analytical work versus engineering work:

* doing something that does not lead to your decisions being accepted by others without additional questions – creating internal work artifacts;
* changing the surrounding world with your decisions in such a way that everyone understands these are your decisions, your responsibility, and do not interfere – creating external work artifacts.

Record these percentages in a table: it is advisable to extract these numbers from your Pomodoro exocortex. You can separately divide work and personal projects.

Locate the relevant task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
