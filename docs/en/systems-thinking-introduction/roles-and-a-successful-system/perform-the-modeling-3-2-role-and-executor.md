# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.2. Role and Executor

Review the example in the first row of the table. Notice that the project name includes both the system name and the main method. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Record the names of people you know who fulfill these roles. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with acquaintances who are experts.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can record questions related to your project.

Locate the corresponding task by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its parts.
