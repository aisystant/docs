# Role Executor, Role, Function, and System Names

In the previous section, we touched a little on the difference between a physical object, a functional object, and functional (or role-based) behavior. For example, a physical object could be a microscope[ ^1 ] or a stone. These objects can assume different roles and perform various functions assigned to them by someone. In our example, the functional object or role is "nail driver." Culturally, this role is referred to as a "hammer." The function or functional or role-based behavior is nail driving.

As we mentioned earlier, each role is associated with culturally-conditioned[ ^2 ] behavior and an associated name entrenched in culture. Everyone understands what a "hammer" role means and its nail-driving behavior. The physical object that can become a hammer[ ^3 ] may vary.

This approach to thinking, where things are named according to their primary function[ ^4 ], substantially saves mental energy. We first consider actions (behavior and other activities) before identifying the physical objects capable of performing these actions. Cultural conditioning allows for quicker agreements[ ^5 ]; for instance, there's no need to repeatedly call a functional object "a person who drives a car." Instead, we refer to this role as a driver[ ^6 ]. 

Here's a brief excerpt from what's written in the "Systems Thinking" textbook:

"Systems are primarily viewed as functional (role-based) objects when they perform their function—they are ready and operational. At this moment, they provide value to those who need that function. For example, an airplane as a system is primarily a role or functional object that flies itself while transporting passengers and cargo through the air. Its most common purpose or function is to enable flight, which is reflected in the name 'airplane.'

The primary purpose of a pump is to pump. This is why the name of the product has become established in culture. Producers aim to please customers by naming their products so customers quickly understand their benefits. Customers consciously (or intuitively) grasp the desired function and start familiarizing themselves with a producer’s products through their functional names[ ^7 ]. Nevertheless, a system named by the producer as 'Pump NV-23'[ ^8 ] may serve another function for the client, like circulating antifreeze. Thus, the client's functional request changes; they need a functional object, an antifreeze injector. Will the 'Pump NV-23' suit the role of an 'antifreeze injector'? Perhaps it will.

Therefore, a pump can be named the 'Antifreeze Injector in the Second Cooling Circuit' if its intended role is injecting antifreeze into the second circuit. The factory will sell the physical object 'Pump NV-23'[ ^9 ], but the buyer will use it for another role—as an injector. This happens all the time. Without a context of use, it's just a 'pump,' a structural object without an environment. Within the context of role use, it's a role object, the 'Antifreeze Injector in the Second Cooling Circuit.' Without the context of her engineering abilities, Masha is just Masha; she could be many things. Similarly, a microscope can show small objects but also crack nuts, drive nails, or be used as a paperweight. Like Masha, it can do many things. However, when performing an engineer's role, Masha will be called 'engineer.' And that's perfectly normal."

Thus, it is important to name systems according to their primary purpose[ ^10 ], that is, the roles assigned to them. These roles define the function. Sometimes the function is clear, but naming the role can be difficult[ ^11 ]. To easily determine role names, having a broad activity perspective is necessary.

When naming a system "microscope," we primarily mean it allows "viewing small objects" when fully assembled and operational. If we intended to use this object to hammer, we would say that the physical object "Microscope MP-2" would take on the role of a "hammer" and perform the function of hammering or pounding.

Now, if someone declares a person a system, usually little can be immediately said about their function in the environment. A person is a multifunctional object capable of performing numerous actions. A person can be viewed as a biological body (from this perspective, for instance, medicine looks at a person). We said in the previous section that a person can play various roles. Therefore, role-based behavior or functions of people will always need a separate and special analysis. However, thinking about people in roles and considering a microscope-in-role is structured the same way![ ^12 ]

If you find it challenging to understand these concepts or fail to see the significance of such differentiation for project activities, it indicates gaps in your ontological knowledge. To master systems thinking, it is essential to have a cognitive type machine[ ^13 ] in mind. If you encounter difficulties with this, we recommend taking the course "Rational Work."

[ ^1 ]: While saying "microscope," we primarily refer to the role "microscope." But it's also a name for the physical item commonly known as a microscope. Context helps distinguish this difference. It's beneficial if you catch this duality, as with a hammer. A systems person comprehends this distinction well. Beginning with a stone is advisable.

[ ^2 ]: Or influenced by cultural norms and rules, meaning accepted within culture, behavioral norms, usage, etc.

[ ^3 ]: That is, play the role of a hammer. Notice the reasoning is similar if discussing how John Doe or Jane Doe could play the manager role.

[ ^4 ]: Or according to their role behavior.

[ ^5 ]: Although not all well-established names adhere to this principle. Some ancient names have unclear origins and often point to shape or something else, not role/function. It's good etiquette for a development team to find not the physical object representing a system but its role—a designation for the role's function or actions.

[ ^6 ]: Similarly, it was suggested earlier not to call a functional object "nail driver," but rather refer to the role as "hammer."

[ ^7 ]: Products may also have alternative names; for example, airplanes bear the names of great individuals.

[ ^8 ]: Here we're discussing a physical object—'Pump NV-23,' which can perform the function of pumping and serve the role of a pump.

[ ^9 ]: This product was intended to perform the role of a pump to execute the pumping function.

[ ^10 ]: Bear in mind that this principle may not hold with well-established names, but adhering to it in your projects can save significant time. You'll be able to reach agreements faster and understand clients' requests and your product more clearly. For more on naming systems, see section 5 of the online course "Systems Thinking."

[ ^11 ]: The need for the "nail-driving" function is apparent, making "nail driver" the role. But naming the role "hammer" requires an activity perspective. The hammer is relatively straightforward for everyone, but try naming project roles at an aircraft factory or a plane's subsystems.

[ ^12 ]: Systems thinking begins by viewing systems as role-based (functional) objects behaving a certain way in their environment. We first consider the performed or required function, role, or purpose, and then examine the structure or physical object that can fill the defined role.

[ ^13 ]: Reminder: This is the ability to track the types of applied concepts and not confuse, for example, role and executor, system and process, function and structure, etc.
