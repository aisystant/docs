# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.7. Intention, Preference, and Subject of Interest

Review the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material on the differences between the concepts of "subject of interest," "preference," and "intention." Determine which of these concepts relate to the role and which to the executor of the role. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Keep in mind that the project role may be external or internal to the system.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. It is sufficient to provide one example in each cell.

Locate the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its tasks.
