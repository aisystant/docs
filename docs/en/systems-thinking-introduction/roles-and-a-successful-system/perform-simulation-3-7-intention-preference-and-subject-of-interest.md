# Perform Modeling: 3.7. Intention, Preference, and Subject of Interest

Review the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material on the differences between "subject of interest," "preference," and "intention." Which of these concepts relate to a role, and which relate to the executor of the role? Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Keep in mind that a project role can be external or internal to the system.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. It is sufficient to provide one example in each cell.

Locate the corresponding assignment in your modeling workspace using the designated number and complete all its tasks.
