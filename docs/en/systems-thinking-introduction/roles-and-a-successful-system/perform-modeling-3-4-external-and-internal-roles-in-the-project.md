# Perform Modeling: 3.4. External and Internal Roles in the Project

**Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. Fill in the blank cells in the rows following the examples.**

Provide examples from work and personal projects. Describe the external and internal roles in your projects, ensuring to specify those roles that use or interact with your enterprise's product. Donâ€™t forget the roles you yourself perform. If necessary, create notes for further development. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section, and later compile them to send to us at support@system-school.ru. We would appreciate any feedback you provide.
