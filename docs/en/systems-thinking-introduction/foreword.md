# Course Introduction: "Introduction to Systems Thinking"

The **"Introduction to Systems Thinking"** course will guide you in taking the first steps into the intriguing realm of systems thinking. In this course, you will be introduced to the main concepts of systems thinking and begin applying them to both work-related and personal projects.

You have the option to undertake the **"Introduction to Systems Thinking"** course independently or as part of group learning with an instructor. If you enroll in the course with an instructor, you will receive feedback on all your questions and assessments of your homework. The instructor will point out numerous pitfalls, help you navigate complex aspects, and expedite your understanding of the challenging systems thinking.

The course comprises **7 sections**^[We highly recommend arming yourself with a pen or making notes on your computer while reading. It has been proved that consuming information and simultaneously noting down emerging ideas and questions make learning much more effective.] and **7 homework assignments** (henceforth referred to as HW) that you will need to complete using personal life examples and work projects. Each HW requires practicing **thinking through writing**.^[Thinking through writing is the principal method of learning complex methodology: if you’re not writing, you're likely not learning. If you compose your HW in writing, you’re engaging and developing your intellect.] The results need to be posted as a draft in the AISYSTANT club. In your draft, use the notes and rough drafts you will write throughout the course.

When completing homework, it is strongly recommended to model using appropriate tables. Such work serves as a training exercise in systems thinking. The establishment of systems thinking occurs through:

* Studying theory (concepts, principles, thinking techniques) outlined in the course "Introduction to Systems Thinking";
* Modeling with examples from the homework;
* Modeling several of your actual projects, which you will primarily realize during the second semester.

Each homework assignment includes several exercises for modeling in the form of template tables, to be filled out according to provided examples. The headings of the template tables are meta-meta-models ("from the textbook") for describing some project activity, whereas the contents of the filled tables are usually meta-models or models (from a particular applied subject area). By filling in the template tables, you are engaged in modeling.

Nearly all template tables are divided into the following blocks:

* An example of a filled table that you must study carefully, paying attention to the connection between systems thinking concepts in the table heading and specific real-life examples;
* An assignment to fill in the missing cells based on the example;
* An assignment to model a work project;
* An assignment to model a personal life project (for instance, systems such as the body, teeth, core, workplace, etc.).

In the framework of the **"Introduction to Systems Thinking"** course with an instructor, you will study the corresponding online course, model simple personal and work projects in tables, and receive feedback from the instructor. In conclusion, it is recommended to write a final system essay.

Systems thinking is no easier than mathematical analysis. However, even the least outstanding student managed to succeed through certain practices of self-development. Therefore, each student in the course will need to undertake the following independent work:

* Organize systematic slow reading of each section of the online course and additional literature over a week (preferably daily, not all at once) and take educational notes. ^[On the Aisystant platform, educational notes are automatically sent to the club, where they can be collected in drafts and later published as a post in the club.]
* Regularly implement the practice of thinking through writing while doing HW and compose 8 drafts (one for each of the seven sections and a final draft on completing the course);
* Modify your current schedule, planning 10–15 hours a week over 2 months for studying the course; ^[If you desire a comfortable and leisurely pace: cover one section per week. If you have more time, you can complete the course faster. However, it's recommended to allocate at least a month to mindfully complete all the HW.] and maintain a routine during this period. ^[If you don't alter your schedule and, for example, don’t get enough rest, sleep well, and maintain a healthy lifestyle, you might lack the energy for demanding intellectual work.]
* Keep a constant record of the time invested in learning according to your schedule and allocated slots for each day of the week.

Pay attention to personal organization: systematic HW completion, planning, and time management for learning. It is crucial to monitor the overall time invested to adapt to complex learning and to observe positive progress at the early stages in the form of completed plans for time investment in the course. ^[Substantive results in work projects and life in general will manifest later. You'll need to persevere until then. Focusing on time investment will help achieve results.] Afterward, you will gain a deeper understanding of the essence of systems methodology.

Throughout the course, expanding your activity horizon will be beneficial, specifically learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts in various activity spheres. You may possess a decent activity horizon in anatomy (system “organism”), but perhaps have lesser knowledge of terms in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. Systems thinking is not desk work; you’ll need to interact with many people! Don’t delay it for the future, start today. For instance, write, call, or talk over a cup of coffee with colleagues or friends. Additionally, use our AI-bot Aisystant, ChatGPT, and Google.

I hope that your first step into systems thinking will be successful, unveiling a world of methodology that literally changes worldviews and lives. 

To complete homework assignments, use your personal work space for modeling:
