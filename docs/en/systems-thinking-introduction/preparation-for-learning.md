# Preparation for Learning

Before embarking on the course project, allocate 30 minutes to organize your work for the first week. After testing, you can make adjustments in the second and subsequent weeks.

This task is particularly important for those who haven't engaged in long-term learning for some time. Treat studying the course as regular brain training, through which you reprogram your thinking. Therefore, pay close attention to the assignments, and it's advisable to describe your thoughts (hypotheses) for each task in a few words, as this will help you begin thinking through writing. For example, you might respond to completing the second task like this: "I want to study the course in the morning before work for 30 minutes, then allocate 1 hour during the day, and another 30 minutes in the evening. To do this, I'll start shifting my evening awake time to morning study time. I'll begin by going to bed 15 minutes earlier, and by waking up earlier, I'll start studying at least 15 minutes a day and gradually increase this time to 30 minutes."

1. Describe your expectations from the course. You can list work and life problems, as well as what you would like to improve in yourself. Completing this task in writing will increase the likelihood of successfully finishing the course, and it will also be useful to compare your expectations throughout the course and when preparing for defense at the end of the course.
2. Change your daily routine to include the course studies. Find 1-2 hours for the course each day during the first week of study, literally allocating this time in your personal calendar. Write a hypothesis similar to the example above. Revisit it after a week and amend it below your initial hypothesis.
3. Choose a time tracker to allocate time for the course (preferably 2-4 Pomodoros a day, each lasting 25-30 minutes). For instance, in the Focus To Do smartphone app, there is a group Aisystant that you can join using the code: JNSYL. Create a project called "My Learning" in the tracker. Start using the ritual of turning on the tracker: when you activate it, think about playing the role of a student and that by the end of the Pomodoro you should have a read section (pages), composed educational notes, and some work artifacts related to the project. Try not to study without turning on the Pomodoro tracker and observing the ritual! Write about how you understand this important student ritual, and if necessary, check out the post in the Aisystant club: <https://systemsworld.club/t/forgetting-to-start-your-pomodoro-tracker-why-its-important-and-how-to-develop-the-habit/11580>
4. Register at Coda (for example, via the link: <https://dash.partnerstack.com/invite/47d92fe146214dec904c286c31f77015>) or in another similar program if you wish to engage in professional modeling.
5. Organize your workspace so that nothing distracts you while studying the course. It's advisable to choose a well-ventilated room, a comfortable chair, and a screen that allows you to split it into two parts: on one screen, you study the course, while on the other, you take notes and model tables. Try to develop a ritual: you sit at your workspace, turn on the Pomodoro timer, prepare to assume the role of a student, and create various work artifacts.
6. Explain to yourself that while studying the course, you are not compiling a summary but are indeed recording your thoughts by composing educational notes. If you still don't know how to take notes (you don't have your own knowledge base), we recommend temporarily recording your thoughts in the "Questions for Review and Further Study" cells (this section is found before the "Homework" subsection in each section). Choose the most suitable question related to your thought, or write down your thought in the cell with the last item "My Notes on the Studied Section." Thus, while gradually studying the course section, you'll gather answers to all questions without writing them from scratch after reading the entire section.

Try to read the section in the first three days of the study week, allocating the remaining time for modeling and completing homework. Meanwhile, reserve the last day before the training with the instructor (or the 6th day of the week) as a backup. If you plan correctly, you'll be able to use this day to review the studied material, help fellow students, or comment on drafts in the Aisystant club (not just fellow students) or formulate questions for the instructor.
