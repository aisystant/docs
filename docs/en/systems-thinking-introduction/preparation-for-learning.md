# Preparation for Learning

### Starting Your Educational Journey

Before you begin the course, set aside 30 minutes to organize your work for the first week. After testing, you can make adjustments for the second week and beyond.

This task is especially crucial for those who haven't engaged in long-term learning recently. Approach this course as a regular training session for your mind, wherein your thinking is being reprogrammed. Pay close attention to the assignments, and ideally, describe your thoughts (hypotheses) in a few words for each task; this will help you start thinking through writing. For example, you might respond to a second assignment like this: "I want to study the course in the morning for 30 minutes before work, then dedicate 1 hour during the day, and another 30 minutes in the evening. To do this, I'll shift some evening time to the morning for study: I'll start going to bed 15 minutes earlier, and waking up earlier I'll begin studying for at least 15 minutes a day, eventually extending this time to 30 minutes."

1. **Describe Your Expectations for the Course**: List out your work and life challenges, as well as what you'd like to improve in yourself. Completing this task in writing will increase your chances of successfully completing the course. It will also be helpful to compare your expectations throughout the course and during the preparation for the final review.

2. **Adjust Your Daily Routine**: Incorporate study time into your schedule. Allocate 1-2 hours daily for the course during the first week, marking this time in your personal calendar. Write out your hypothesis similar to the example above. Revisit it after a week and add any amendments to your initial hypothesis.

3. **Select a Time-Tracking Tool**: Choose a tracker to monitor your study time (ideally 2-4 Pomodoro sessions per day, with each session lasting 25-30 minutes). For example, the smartphone app Focus To Do has an Aisystant group that can be joined with the code: JNSYL. Create a project titled "My Learning" in the tracker. Begin using a ritual when activating the tracker: when you start, think about acting in the role of a student and at the end of each session, you should have read a section, made educational notes, or produced some work artifacts for the project. Try not to study without the Pomodoro tracker active and without following the ritual! Describe how you understood this important student ritual, and if necessary, review the post in the Aisystant club: <https://systemsworld.club/t/zabyvaete-vklyuchat-treker-pomodoro-pochemu-eto-vazhno-i-kak-postavit-privychku/11580>

4. **Register with Coda**: Sign up for Coda (for instance, through the link: <https://dash.partnerstack.com/invite/47d92fe146214dec904c286c31f77015>) or another similar program if you wish to model using a professional tool.

5. **Organize Your Study Environment**: Arrange your workspace to minimize distractions during study. Ideally, choose a well-ventilated room, a comfortable chair, and a screen that can be split into two parts: one for studying the course and the other for taking notes and modeling tables. Try to develop a ritual: sit at your desk, activate the Pomodoro timer, set the mindset to act as a student, and create various work artifacts.

6. **Understand the Course Note-Taking**: Explain to yourself that while studying the course, you're not merely taking notes, but also recording your thoughts by making educational notes. If you're not yet familiar with note-taking (or donâ€™t have your knowledge base), we recommend jotting down your thoughts in the "Questions for Review and Further Study" section (found in each section before the "Homework" subsection). Choose the most relevant question that relates to your thought, or record your thought in the "My Notes on the Learned Section" cell. This way, as you gradually study a section of the course, you will gather answers to all the questions instead of writing them from scratch after reading the entire section.

Try to read the section during the first three days of the study week, using the remaining time for modeling and completing homework. Reserve the last day before the instructor-led training (or the 6th day of the week) as a backup. If you plan correctly, you'll be able to use this day to review studied material, assist your peers, comment on drafts in the Aisystant club (not just peers), or formulate questions for the instructor.
