# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.4. Identify System Levels

Familiarize yourself with the two examples provided in the table. In the third row, the "Enterprise Product" is the system of interest for each example. Above it are the supersystem and the supersupersystem, and below it are the subsystems and sub-subsystems for one of the subsystems.

Fill in the empty cells with examples from your own work and personal projects, in which you identify the systems of interest (product). Focus your attention on two system levels above and two levels below the product of your enterprise, following the pattern of the examples provided.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
