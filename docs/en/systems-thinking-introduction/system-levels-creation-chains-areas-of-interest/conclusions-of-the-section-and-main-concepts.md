# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

Areas of interest are several related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas of interest are the focus of attention for all roles in a project. Since there are quite a few subjects of interest, for convenience, they can be grouped into specific areas. We distinguish areas of interest for the supersystem, the system of interest, and the creation systems, as well as subject areas of interest for the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

Levels in the hierarchy of a system breakdown are called system levels. At each level, the system constructor identifies its own roles, methods, systems, concepts, and so on.

Creation chains are creation systems that plan, create, and dispose of other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the technique of distinguishing all the concepts covered in this section. However, it may not be easy to immediately apply these concepts to your own project. This requires experience in implementing several projects.

Key concepts: areas of interest, area of interest of the supersystem, system of interest, creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, model, activity roles; system breakdown, system levels, meta-system transition, emergence; creation chain; misalignments, systems approach 3.0, scale-independence, de-anthropomorphization, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
