# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.3. Areas of Interest of the Supersystem

Familiarize yourself with the example of a project description across three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your enterprise or project. Use the practice of thinking through writing, and for the first attempt, try to describe them as best you can. After that, edit your description, leaving only the most important points. You may also return to your description after some time. As your project develops, remember to update this description—it is useful for compiling all other descriptions and for coordinating teamwork. As needed, create notes for further elaboration. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the “Notes” section.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.
