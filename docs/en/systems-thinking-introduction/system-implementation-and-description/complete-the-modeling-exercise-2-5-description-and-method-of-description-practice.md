# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.5. Description and Method of Description (Practice)

Familiarize yourself with the examples. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the examples. Provide at least two options (as shown in the example). If your knowledge is not broad enough to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. As needed, create notes for further follow-up. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write a question to ask in support chats or jot down a thought for a future draft.

Provide several examples from both work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
