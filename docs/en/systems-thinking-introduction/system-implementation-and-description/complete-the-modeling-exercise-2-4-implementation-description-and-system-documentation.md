# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.4. Implementation, Description, and System Documentation

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the data provided may fit a wide range of situations; you only need to provide at least one example. The main thing is to avoid methodological mistakes.

For your current or past projects (or projects of your friends that you are familiar with), fill out the table by specifying at least five implementations of the system, descriptions of this system, and documents containing descriptions of this system.

One example of a description and one document with this description per system implementation is sufficient, but you may include more: a single implementation may have many descriptions, and one description may be documented on various information carriers/in a variety of documents. In the table, write only the names of the requested items; there is no need to include full texts or diagrams!

As needed, make notes for further elaboration. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can record your insights that arise when using thinking through writing as you fill out the table.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
