# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

In this section, we discussed the cognitive technique of distinguishing between implementation, description, documentation, and function of the system. You could say that any description is a description of a system. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The main relationships in systems are the “part-whole” relationships, also known as composition/assembly relationships. Breakdowns are made solely by focusing our attention—nothing in the physical world is specifically broken down into parts!

Every system has a function or role-based behavior that is required by certain external design roles. Systems are usually named according to their primary purpose or main function.

Complex systems are defined by the objects included within that complex system. At the same time, we do not refer to complex systems as processes—these are different types of concepts.

Key concepts: physical world, mental space; system description, implementation of the system, system documentation; method of description; functional object = role-based object, role-based behavior = function = purpose in the environment (system’s purpose); physical object = role performer = module; naming of systems; “part-whole” relationship = composition/assembly relationship, system breakdown, system levels; complex system, process.
