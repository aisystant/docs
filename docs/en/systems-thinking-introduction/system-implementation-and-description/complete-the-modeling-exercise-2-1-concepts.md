# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.1 Concepts

Write down the five (or more) concepts from this section that stood out to you the most, and next to each, indicate the concepts with which you associate them most strongly. These other concepts can come from your current worldview, so you do not have to list only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with your fellow students, colleagues, or close friends. For example, you might try explaining these concepts in simple terms, giving examples from your own experience, connecting different concepts to each other, or explaining their importance.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
