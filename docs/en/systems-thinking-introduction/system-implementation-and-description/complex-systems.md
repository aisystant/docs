# Complex Systems

We can talk about complex systems by referring to the relationships among their components. At the beginning of this section, we used the example of a cocktail. However, the implementation of a system can also be a system made up of spatially separated 4D objects. For example, a water rescue system, which includes rescuers, lifeboats, life rings, and so on. Unlike an airplane, or a motor, we will refer to such systems as complex systems.

Complex systems are defined by the objects that are included in the given complex system. At the same time, we do not refer to complex systems as processes—these are different types of concepts. They should not be confused, just as you would not confuse types like “furniture chair” and “color red,” “cities” and “countries,” “roles” and “positions,” and so on.

When we say “process,” it means we stop considering the system and shift our attention^[In the same way as we shifted our attention from description to implementation or documentation of the system.] to focus on the interaction between several systems. We can also consider a process that takes place within a system.

A process is usually named with a verb or a verbal noun. For example, the process of “hammering a nail.” It is very difficult to actually observe the process of hammering a nail. Processes themselves, as changes, are invisible (remember, the process of movement is noticeable because of the system). But you can imagine a process as a list of physical objects involved in it. That is, “hammering a nail” consists of a nail, a hammer, a board, and a carpenter.

It is a bit more difficult to identify the objects in a process if, for example, a stone is used as a hammer, a wall takes the place of the board, and you yourself play the role of the carpenter—so you might forget to include yourself in the process.

But this approach of reducing “processes” to material objects that change each other through interaction remains a reliable method for identifying work, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behaviors in the physical world. However, it is crucial not to forget that a process is not a system, but rather the interaction of systems. It is this interaction that matters to us. For example, the word “performance” indicates that an action (a process) is taking place, involving actors, music, and a stage. In this case, the complex system is the theater, which includes numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, look for objects in the world that are described by nouns, not actions described by verbs—objects that behave in some way during interactions and manifest their behavior in the world. Although it is not always possible to find precise names for them—such names may not exist in the culture, or they may be assigned to other types. For example, consider the word “dance”: is it a system or a process?

You can think about the most complex and the simplest systems in more or less the same way, which demonstrates the universality of systems thinking. Once you understand it, you will save a great deal of mental energy and be able to navigate even the most complex situations and projects much more quickly.
