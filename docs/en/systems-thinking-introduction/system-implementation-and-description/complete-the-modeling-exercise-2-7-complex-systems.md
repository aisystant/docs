# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.7. Complex Systems

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material, and use the AI-bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts.

Provide examples from your work and personal projects by listing the subsystems of your organization's systems. If needed, create notes for further development. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can record reflections or questions to ask later in support chats, or jot down ideas for future drafts. You may also leave feedback for the course developers in the “Notes” section.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
