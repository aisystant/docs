title: 'Perform Modeling: 1.6. Classical Properties of a System'
---

Text translated to English:

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Note that the "System" column contains examples of ideal objects. Recall the difference between the classical systems concept and the systems concept 2.0, particularly what objective and subjective examination of a system means.

Describe the properties of the systems listed in the table. You may also come up with your own examples. Highlight the classic properties of systems from work-related and personal projects.

If needed, create notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, record reflections or questions that can later be addressed in support chats.
