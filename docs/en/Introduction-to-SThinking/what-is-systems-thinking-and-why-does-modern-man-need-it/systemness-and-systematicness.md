title: Systemness and Systematicness
---

Most people operate with a **"household" understanding of the concepts of "system" and "systems thinking."** They associate "using systems approach" with personal organization, diligence, a desire to anticipate everything, consider every possible detail, and everything that might be important. And this is incorrect!

**"Using systems approach" is often confused with "systematicness,"** and systematic poor or incorrect thinking leads to disastrous results. Although many dictionaries define using systems approach and systematicness as synonyms, we will differentiate these concepts. **Systematicness, regularity, discipline** mean that a person consistently does something according to a schedule, whereas **using systems approach** implies that a person can "cut" the world into different systems with their attention and work with these systems and various people's interests. This is a separate thinking (systems) technique that requires systematic training.

Using systems approach determines "what to do," while systematicness means doing it regularly, consistently, rhythmically. One concept does not replace the other. **You need to be both systems-oriented and systematic.** This course focuses on using systems approach, while the "Practices of Self-Development" course covers systematicness.

It is widely known that everything in the world is interconnected, but using systems approach is not just about ensuring no detail is missed. It is essential to **highlight what is important from the overall context** and, conversely, incorporate something important into the overall context. Systems thinking directs the attention of a specialist or team during project implementation. Objects of attention are defined by specific concepts^[Such concepts were introduced at the beginning of the previous subsection: roles, methods, work products, systems, architecture, etc. We will study several dozen systems thinking concepts in this course.]. Using these concepts, we focus our attention on both whatâ€™s important and on contexts. Therefore, our course:

* introduces several dozen such **systems concepts**;
* teaches **thinking techniques** and corresponding systems modeling that connect these concepts;
* develops the skill of **identifying these concepts** in work and personal projects.

We will present two systems thinking techniques, among others, that will be covered in the course.

The first technique highlights that **any activity can be viewed through three interconnected areas.** These areas should answer the following questions:

1. Why, for whom, and what is the rationale for doing something, and how will they change their behavior if offered something new?
2. What is this new thing from the perspective of the product (system), what are its characteristics, how is it structured, and from what is it made?
3. Who will create the system, how will they do it, using what methods and resources?

The second technique concerns **the connection between analysis and synthesis, or the identification of functions and constructions of the system.** In corporate culture, much emphasis is placed on analysis. And rightly so. However, one must not forget that analytical activity is just a part; synthesis is also needed. Analysis involves breaking down into parts, while synthesis involves combining and producing a working product (system). Systems thinking utilizes both functional analysis, which divides the system into functional parts, and modular synthesis, which assembles the whole system from structural parts. It is the working product or physical construction that is something new and changes behavior (changes the world), and it is for this that money is paid.

Given the above, you need to prepare for the fact that many of your current perceptions will conflict with the methodology of systems thinking. If you work with these discrepancies using thinking through writing (modeling), your worldview will significantly update by the end of the course.
