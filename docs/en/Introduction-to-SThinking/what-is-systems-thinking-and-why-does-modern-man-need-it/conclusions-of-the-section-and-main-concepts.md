Regular tasks are addressed using applied mastery, but when the complexity of problems and tasks gets overwhelming, **intellect or thinking mastery** is engaged.

Modern trends indicate that people increasingly encounter **new problems and complex tasks**, which require consideration of diverse interests for their resolution. Therefore, the following expectations can be outlined for an intellect that demonstrates a systems approach:

* integration of different worldviews;
* versatility in solving complex problems across various spheres of activity;
* continuous improvement in the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity requires a high-level theory capable of linking different worldviews together. For this, there is an **intellect stack comprising 16 transdisciplines**, and an intellect equipped with this stack provides the function of systems thinking. This enables systemically-minded people to coherently connect the diverse interests of stakeholders.

**Main Concepts**: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classical properties of a system: wholeness, emergence, nesting; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, self-development practices, applied practices; systematicity, using systems approach; applied mastery, thinking mastery, intellect, life mastery.
