**The Concept of "Systems Thinking"**

There is no single precise definition of the **concept of "systems thinking,"** much like it is impossible to provide a single complete definition for the concept of "mother." We can say that systems thinking is thinking where the concept of a system and other concepts from the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack) are used. Or that thinking using systems approach is thinking in a systems language^[Post "In What Language Do You Think?" in the Aisystant Club: <https://systemsworld.club/t/na-kakom-yazyke-ty-dumaesh/7878>]. Also, systems thinking creates successful products and services by considering multiple interests^[Throughout the course, you will receive dozens of explanations of what systems thinking is. You will even come up with your own explanations and analogies.].

Systems thinking is neither supernatural, mystical, nor esoteric. We're not delving into the neurostructure of thinking or discussing various psychological aspects. We believe that any kind of thinking is developed by studying certain theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real life. These are the concepts you'll be learning and applying in both your professional and personal projects.

**Why is Systems Thinking Necessary?**

Our world is complex and changing rapidly. But what makes it complex, and what exactly is changing so fast?

The complexity lies in the fact that there are **many different people's interests.** These interests, along with knowledge, work methods, workplace environments, teams, and fields of activity, change rapidly. To create successful products and services, one needs to **navigate modern speeds and complexities effectively.** This is where systems thinking comes into play.

For example, when creating a car, it is necessary to consider the interests of the driver, passengers, pedestrians^[To avoid causing significant harm in case of a collision.], car owner^[So that the car does not break down and does not depreciate significantly.], and the automotive corporation^[To ensure the car sells well.], aesthete^[The car should be visually appealing.], environmentalist^[The car should not pollute the environment.], and several hundred more roles. Each interest represents a certain worldview (model, description). Similar interests can be identified in your systems, such as a renovated apartment, a child raised and ready for adulthood, a planted tree, an IT application, a business, etc.

Moreover, in today's world, there’s a need to **quickly adapt to new conditions and** **learn new things in the shortest possible time.** Nowadays, everyone constantly has to learn new practices or professions, and navigate unfamiliar fields of activity, ideally doing so without stress or delays.

Mastery in systems thinking enables one to **understand a new field of activity** within two weeks. Someone lacking this skill may spend years studying the same activity. Why is this the case? Because someone with systems thinking focuses on the target and other systems (supersystem, system creation, etc.), roles, methods, work products, functional and modular parts, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and other focal points that are present in any field. All these concepts can be found in IT, culinary arts, even in infrastructure projects (transportation operations).

Humanity is progressing towards **labor division.** For instance, centuries ago, there was one role, "medicus," that addressed all human illnesses; now, medicine has hundreds (if not thousands) of roles. This labor division occurs in all fields of human endeavor. However, no single individual can master all roles in depth. To determine which specialists and roles you require in your projects, systems thinking is essential. It allows you to "segment" the world into separate but interconnected systems and subsystems.

Systems thinking not only facilitates quick integration into new projects or worlds, but also helps in **managing focus,** discarding what's unimportant at the moment while maintaining a holistic vision. Our brains may lack the computational power to process all project details, so it is necessary to focus resources on the right "place," and timely shift this "place." Additionally, understanding how all these "places" are arranged and interconnected is crucial. Knowing systems thinking principles can reduce meeting durations from an hour to ten minutes^[We discuss only the essentials, skillfully manage focus, and highlight points of attention for the entire team.].

It is important to note that although systems thinking allows for rapidly addressing work-related problems, it **does not replace applied skill mastery.** However, it enables you to progress faster in the applied field and quickly become a professional.

Systems thinking lets us break down complex projects into simpler parts, **connect theory and practice,** work in large teams, and organize our own team. It also helps us to keep all important project aspects in mind or simulation tools^[Our course, as a simulator, also trains you in modeling.] so nothing is forgotten amidst the chaos.

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, meaning it applies to objects of varying complexity: whether inert substances, living beings, cyber-physical systems, individuals, organizations, communities, or even humanity as a whole.

We believe that systems thinking is essential for any modern person aspiring to build a career, perhaps becoming a business development director of a large enterprise. Yet it’s universal enough to be applied to personal development, parenting, community building, and societal advancement.

**What Do the Words "Systems Thinking" Mean?**

In the previous section, we discussed that most people operate with a **basic understanding of systems thinking** and often confuse "systematic" with "systematicness."

Sometimes, "systems thinking" is seen as a remarkable ability, such as the ability to combine analysis (understood as the ability to dive deeply into details) and synthesis (understood as the ability to surface from these details in time). This is known as the ability to see the big picture. It is as beneficial to have this ability as it is to be wealthy and healthy, rather than poor and sick.

Unfortunately, such explanations are not about "systems" or using systems approach. The narrative on the necessity of diving into and resurfacing from details doesn't provide a strategy for mastering or applying this skill in daily business, engineering, management, or other professional activities.

Systems thinking involves human thinking that operates with a specific systems language. **Systems thinking is thinking using the concept of "system" and other concepts set in **certain** transdisciplines** [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack). This includes **conceptualization, ontology, physics, mathematics, and other fields.** You could also include using cognitive techniques from the systems approach.

There are many **systems approach** methods^[You will learn more about this in the "Systems Thinking" course.]. Essentially, an approach means that concepts, thinking methods, and techniques developed within one discipline (subject area) are then applied to other disciplines and subject areas. Our systems approach version involves applying transdisciplinary concepts, techniques, and methods from the intellect stack to professional and personal areas^[And correspondingly to disciplines required for implementing numerous professional and personal projects. We discuss the third generation of the systems approach.].

The systems approach pertains to methodologies. The emphasis here is on approach—how knowledge is transferred. Systems thinking, on the other hand, represents a human capability (with the emphasis on "thinking").

**Human thinking is an intellectual activity** that enables us to form descriptions of reality. This supports carrying out necessary actions, including the creation of products (systems) and services. To develop these descriptions, we use words (terms, concepts). Without formal study in systems thinking, you are likely to utilize everyday language rather than the concepts of the modern intellect stack.

The difference between a layperson and a systems professional is that the latter operates with systems concepts such as system, role, method (practice), work product, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergence, and others studied in our course.

Systems thinking must be studied specifically, much like mathematics or physics, marketing or management. The first step in any learning (including here) is to pay attention to a conceptual minimum and apply it in practice^[Without studying transdisciplines, systems thinking does not emerge from practice alone, or it would take decades.].

In our course, thinking techniques are also trained. **Thinking techniques** involve the ability to interlink different concepts and find physical objects in real projects associated with these concepts. For instance, locating a *target system* and *creator*, highlighting the *role-method (practice)-work product* connection, dividing a system into *functional* and *modular* parts. This is why we recommend studying this course with mandatory modeling. By applying the concepts and techniques of systems thinking to a project, **the team saves time and resources in creating a successful system** and reaches consensual decisions more swiftly.

During this process, you’ll have to **think simultaneously about three interlinked systems:** the *"target system,"*, *"supersystem,"* and *"system creation."* You'll have to master systems thinking across several logical levels, identifying these systems in your activities, clients, and suppliers. You'll need to consider the numerous stakeholders within these systems, recognize their interests, roles, and positions, and subsequently prepare different descriptions (models) of these systems accordingly. Throughout this, it’s essential not to confuse *positions* and *roles*.

It is important to emphasize that **systems thinking represents a particular intellectual behavior.** Intelligence addresses new problems, i.e., situations you have yet to encounter. To handle these, systems thinking concepts and techniques are required.

Humans **think using mastered concepts and techniques,** using them to describe the world, work projects, and systems being created. Therefore, one might say systems thinking replicates the knowledge of the "Systems Thinking" course just as mathematical thinking replicates the knowledge of a mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks in systems language, forms systems descriptions, and creates successful systems. In systems thinking, the term "successful system" means it was created considering the interests of all identified project roles involved with the system.

Systems thinking brings **universality,** **speed,** and **quality** to solving new complex problems when working with different stakeholders. The speed at which successful systems are created is a hallmark of systems thinking. This involves the ability to manage different interests, addressed through creating a systems description. Such consideration of varied interests enables solving the most complex challenges, whether they confront humanity at large or an individual, across a wide range of activities.
