title: Systems Approach 2.0
---

In the classic systems approach, systems were considered as material objects with three properties: **wholeness**, **emergence**, and **embeddedness**^[Don't confuse "embeddedness" with "hierarchy." The latter may appear in descriptions of first-generation system properties, but it's incorrect. Hierarchy is a broader principle than embeddedness. Embeddedness is a specific instance of hierarchy; not every hierarchy means embeddedness. For example, a supervisor and subordinate represent a hierarchy, but not embeddedness.]. However, these systems were viewed as ideal physical objects, unrelated to human interests. The connection with human interests appeared in what is known as systems approach 2.0, which is based on entirely different systems methodologies compared to the first generation^[There are diverse system methodologies in both the first and second generations of systems approach. Each contains its own set of concepts and thinking techniques. Their common distinctive feature is that besides the concept of "system," each uses the concept of "role," "stakeholder," or "interested parties." One of such second-generation system methodologies is TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving).].

Systems approach 2.0 doesn't reject the classic system properties introduced in the first generation. These remain necessary conditions for existence, but they are no longer sufficient. In its modern interpretation, the concept of "system" is equipped with new additional properties derived from the **subjective perspective** on the system.

As mentioned earlier, the classic approach is more abstract and considers ideal objects, whereas the **second-generation systems approach is pragmatic**, dealing with objects needed by someone or influencing certain people.

Systems approach 2.0 does not apply when it's a matter of talking about a table, a clock, or a car without a real project. This is akin to ideal objects in mental space, often not representing specific physical objects required by particular people in particular projects.

Systems thinking arises when discussing systems like "office desk," "wristwatch," or "passenger car." In these cases, at least you can talk about **interests and interested roles** that have needs related to these systems. Based on that, the system is identified, its boundaries, and its intended use.

In systems approach 2.0, all project roles influencing the system or individuals in certain roles who may be affected by it are considered interested. The sum of all project roles' interests determines what the system will be like, its function, what it will consist of, and so on.

The thinking method here is "No interests, no system." For instance, an Automotive corporation creates a passenger car considering potential clients' interests such as the driver, passenger, user, owner, pedestrians, regulatory bodies, environmental protection advocates, etc. Whether it will be a passenger or cargo vehicle, what kind of engine it will have, or its payload depends on the stakeholders' interests.

Every considered interest determines what the vehicle should be like. Without an ecological interest, there wouldn't be a need to install an exhaust gas cleaning subsystem meeting Euro-6 standards. By installing such a subsystem, the manufacturer changed the system's configuration.

Everything installed in a passenger car **responds to some interest of a project role** that the automaker decided to address. The "passenger car" system will be successful if the interests of all stakeholders (project roles) are taken into account (satisfied).

**Let's go on to discuss this systems thinking method: first look "outward," and only then "inward" into the system.**

The interaction between the system and project roles determines its boundary (wholeness), function, and design. Hence, **a system discussion begins not with the internal design, but with understanding** **its** **environment**. This means identifying the supersystem the system belongs to, who needs it, what these stakeholders require, and their problems and interests in the system. From this emerges an important systems principle: always start looking outside the system before looking inside.

For instance, in a classic examination of the "clock" system, a person would start by examining the system's properties internally, discussing its components. In contemporary examination, one must **begin by looking outward** at the system, seeing what supersystem the clock is a part of, who needs it, and how it is used.

Such an examination clarifies whether it's a wristwatch, a cuckoo clock, or a tower clock, acknowledging that each would have different mechanisms. Without listing and understanding the stakeholders' interests, discussing the system's arrangement is impossible.

Thus, in systems approach 2.0, systems not only possess the properties of wholeness, emergence, and embeddedness, but a crucial property is that **systems depend on stakeholders** (project roles). The system's success depends on satisfying the project roles' interests, which is why examination begins with the environment: first looking outward, then inward into the system.
