title: Complexity

**Systems Thinking** deals with complexity. **Complexity** is a concept that has numerous meanings in various contexts and theories. We will discuss complexity in the following contexts:

* When encountering something **new and unknown**, it is inherently complex, as we do not possess pre-established methods to handle it.
* It involves a **complexly arranged system**, such as one consisting of a large number of elements with many connections. This could be a system like "An Enterprise with 1,000 Employees" or "An Electric Car."
* The system includes a **large number of stakeholders** who either influence the system or are influenced by it. Such a system is likely to be complexly arranged, but we highlight this third type of complexity separately to emphasize the numerous interests in the system that must be considered to create a successful system.

**Systems Thinking** helps constantly increase the level of complexity you can handle throughout your life. Besides the ability to work with complexity, a systems thinker also improves their operational speed. However, it is crucial to **acquire fluency (speed) in applying systems thinking** first. To achieve this, one must gradually complicate their systems analysis across different types of systems:

1. Start by examining simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer."
2. Then move on to considering your body and personal mastery.
3. Next, transition to IT systems (cyber-physical systems), where software resembles personality, and "mastery" is one of the applications/application programs in this software^[If you're not an IT specialist, the analogy to personality can help you grasp many aspects of IT. The human body can be viewed as IT hardware, and specific expertise (as part of personality) as software.].
4. After that, consider teams and enterprises.
5. Finally, gain access to higher systemic levels—community, society, humanity…

We do not recommend immediately applying systems thinking to your most complex project. Doing so might only further confuse you and waste your time. Start with the simplest project, and once you achieve fluency, move on to more complex systems.

Our course heavily relies on simple systems, and in the courses "Systems Thinking," "Methodology," and "Systems Engineering," you will reinforce this understanding and see the similarities with other systems. By the end of the "Engineering of Personality" course, you will comprehend personality structures, and upon successfully completing the "System Management" course, you can become a **Director of Development** for an enterprise. Courses focused on higher systemic levels are currently under development.

This step-by-step approach trains the **ability to continuously raise** the **complexity threshold and speed**. Of course, we yearn for everything at once, but life rarely works that way. Systematic approach needs to be developed alongside a systems approach—it will be your competitive advantage and ensure that life remains engaging. A systems thinker with **agency**^[Agency is the ability to set goals and act to improve one's current state. For this, the agent actively influences both themselves and the surrounding world. Agency can be compared to having "a thorn under one’s seat."] will always possess the motivated desire and capability to accomplish something impressive and beneficial to people, elevating complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of infinite growth and personal self-development.
