title: Main Concepts of Systems Thinking
---

Often, when people move to a new country and immerse themselves in a different language, they are asked, "What language do you think in now?" Thinking in a particular language means using that language as a tool for organizing thoughts, planning, reasoning, and internal dialogue^[Language and thinking are strongly connected, but this doesn't mean that thinking entirely depends on language.].

Language is a tool that can shape and structure thought processes. This concept is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis^[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity>]. It suggests that the language we speak influences our perception of the world and our way of thinking.

Typically, when "language" is mentioned, most people immediately think of foreign languages, and few consider professional languages. For instance, the language of a physicist or mathematician, swimmer or driver, engineer or manager. Essentially, throughout their life, a person learns not just Russian or English but also professional languages. In essence, learning professional languages is very similar to learning casual conversational language.

But besides professional languages, there is also a meta-language or systems language. The systems language uses its specific words to denote certain concepts. Moreover, these concepts can be named differently in various foreign languages. For example, a core concept of systems thinking can be expressed by the word "система" in Russian or "system" in English. In addition to the concept of "system" (which I'm currently expressing in Russian), there are other systems thinking concepts such as target system, superset, function, architecture, role, method (practice), and so on.

Therefore, one of the shortest answers to the question "What does systems thinking mean?" is "It's when you think using systems approach language." From there, it can be expanded that systems thinking helps create successful products and services that consider numerous interests.

Learning systems thinking is necessary, much like learning any foreign language. This means studying concepts (words) and applying them in projects and life. It's essential to immerse yourself in the environment, which is why being part of a community of like-minded individuals is so important^[For example, this is why Aisystant is developing as a community of like-minded people, and we recommend writing your drafts in the Aisystant club.]. Of course, it is crucial to take this learning seriously and recognize the importance of mastering the systems language. Achieving fluency will take years.

However, just like with a foreign language, new opportunities arise. These opportunities are even more significant because **the systems approach language opens doors to any professional languages and the creation of successful systems in both work and personal life**. You'll be able to master these professions more quickly in any foreign language.

**So, study systems methodology and think using systems approach language, rather than just in casual Russian or English!**

One of the main skills of a modern person is **the ability to learn quickly**. Humans do this much faster than any other creature on earth. But some people learn more quickly than others, making fewer mistakes and generally living better. To learn rapidly, it's essential to understand that education, first and foremost, is about studying theories. And, of course, theories need to be connected with practical activities. The best theories help humanity advance civilization.

Every theory in turn consists of specific concepts used to describe the world. It's crucial to pay attention to these when studying theories. Write them down and connect them together during courses, and also find their manifestations in the physical world.

In physics, concepts such as physical body, speed, force, etc., are introduced. These concepts are necessary to describe natural phenomena and the structure and evolution of the material world. In accounting, concepts like asset, liability, double-entry, and others are introduced to describe a business's activities (balance sheet) for tax accounting. In a systems thinking course, concepts are collected that are necessary for creating a successful system and organizing a large team of specialists from different fields.

**Can you create systems without systems thinking concepts?** Of course, you can. But it's akin to ignoring the laws of physics or trying to learn to swim just by practicing without understanding the theory of the crawl stroke. You'll still achieve something. We offer an intellectual language for explaining and changing the world, competing with other schools of thought.

With systems thinking concepts, you can not only work faster and increase the complexity of systems you create, but you can also apply these concepts to building completely different systems: IT systems, an airplane, or a home, a nuclear power plant, or a child ready for adulthood.

Try to assess your understanding of systems thinking concepts yourself. Explain them to yourself, or better yet, write down drafts for each point with systems thinking concepts. Here lies a significant portion of the concepts studied in the AISYSTANT courses, grouped so that you not only talk about each concept but also explain its distinction from other similar concepts.

1. Systems concept and systematic approach
2. Synergy and emergence
3. Physical world and mental space
4. Nesting and hierarchy
5. Description, embodiment, and System Documentation
6. Alpha and work product
7. Works and methods (practices)
8. Functional analysis and modular synthesis
9. Processes, projects, and tasks
10. Physical object (executor), functional object (role), and function (behavior)
11. Word, object, and system
12. Function and structure
13. Intention, subject of interest, and preference
14. Role, subject of interest, role interest (preference), and description method
15. Discipline and tools
16. Function and service
17. Improvement and development
18. Strategy and strategizing
19. Work management and methods management (practices)
20. Black and transparent boxes
21. Architecture and non-architecture
22. Systems of systems and people in systems
23. Systems approach and traditional leadership
24. Stages and phases of a project
25. Trans-discipline and discipline, method and theory
26. Role, executor, title, and position
27. Role, method (practice), and work product
28. Dissatisfaction and subject of interest
29. Entrepreneur, engineer, and manager
30. System levels, creation chains, and fields of interest
31. Work management: project management, process management, and case management
32. Organizational roles and organizational units
33. System architecture and enterprise architecture
34. Models, meta-models, multi-models, mega-models
35. Modeling and meta-modeling
36. Meta-system transition and emergence
37. Target system, superset, creation system, system environment, our system, subsystem
38. Successful system and ethics
39. Subject of interest (concern), description method (viewpoint), description (view)

This exercise is beneficial to perform during and after completing each AISYSTANT course. By understanding each concept, you will not only find common ground with entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers, but you'll also accelerate learning new professional knowledge, becoming a sought-after specialist.
