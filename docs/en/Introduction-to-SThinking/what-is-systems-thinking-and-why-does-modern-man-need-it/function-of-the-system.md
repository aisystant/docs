title: Function of the System
---

The separation of the physical world and mental space helps to understand the distinction between a **system** and its **function**. For example, a car is a physical object that exists in the real world. It represents the embodiment of a system or a tangible object that can be touched. Like any system, a car has a function, which in this case is movement. Movement, like any function of a system, is abstract and cannot be touched. However, we can observe movement; more precisely, we see the car as it moves.

A **function** (or behavior, or action) is assigned by people; objects do not choose their own functions. A hammer, by itself, cannot assign itself the function of driving nails. An interested party can take a microscope and designate (name) it a "hammer," that is, assign it the function of driving nails. In this scenario, the hammer becomes nothing more than a role for the microscopeâ€”or a stone. Thus, the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role is driving nails.

People need not so much the object (material entity) itself as they do its function. This is what interested parties value, although the average person rarely shares this perspective. Using systems approach, one learns to separately consider and discuss the **function** that someone needs and the **construction (physical object)** that is best suited to fulfill this function.

The conceptual approach of separating a system from its function can also be applied to thought itself. We can say that thinking is the function of the intellect. In this context, the intellect is the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
