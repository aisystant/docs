Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material and utilize the AI bot Aisystant as needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. If your understanding is insufficient to select the appropriate words and labels (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance.

Include examples from both work and personal projects. Create notes for further exploration as needed. For instance, in the "Notes" column, jot down reflections or questions that you can later pose in support chats.

**Find the corresponding task by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its requirements.**
