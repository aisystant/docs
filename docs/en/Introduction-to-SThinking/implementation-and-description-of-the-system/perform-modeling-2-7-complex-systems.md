Please review the examples in the first rows of the table. If needed, revisit the theoretical material and use the AI tool, Aisystant. Fill in the missing cells in the rows following the examples. If you lack the insight to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with known experts.

Provide examples from your work and personal projects, outlining the subsystems of your enterprise's systems. Create notes for further follow-up as needed. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down reflections or questions to ask in support chats later, or note a thought for future preparation. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section.
