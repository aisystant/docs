title: Complex Systems

We can discuss complex systems by referring to the relationships within their components. An example with a cocktail was given at the beginning of the section. However, a system can be embodied by a **system** consisting of spatially separated 4D-objects. For instance, a water rescue system, which includes lifeguards, boats, life rings, and so forth, is an example. Unlike an airplane or an engine, we classify such systems as complex systems.

**Complex systems are defined by the objects included in them.** We do not refer to complex systems as processes; these are different types of concepts. Confusing these is akin to mixing up categories like 'furniture chair' and 'color red,' 'cities' and 'countries,' 'roles' and 'positions,' etc.

When discussing a **"process,"** it means we stop analyzing the system itself and shift our focus^[Just like shifting from system description to its embodiment or documentation.] to the interaction of several systems. We can also consider a process occurring within a system.

A process is commonly referred to by a verb or a verbal noun. For example, the process of "nailing." It's quite challenging to observe the process of nailing. Processes themselves, as changes, are invisible (remember, the process of motion is noticeable through the system). But a process can be represented as a list of physical items involved in it. Thus, "nailing" involves the nail, the hammer, the plank, and the carpenter.

Identifying objects in a process becomes slightly more complex when a stone acts as the hammer, a wall acts as the plank, and you act as the carpenter, forgetting to include yourself in the process.

Yet, reducing "processes" to material items that interact remains a reliable method for exploring tasks, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behaviors in the physical world. It is crucial, however, to always remember that a **process is not a system, but rather the interaction of systems.** This interaction is what truly matters to us. For example, the word "performance" suggests an activity (a process) involving actors, music, and a stage. Meanwhile, a complex system is the theater itself, encompassing numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, look for actions in the world that are not denoted by verbs but by nounsâ€”objects that behave in interactions and reveal their behavior to the world. Although it may not always be possible to find exact names due to cultural differences or existing associations with other types, consider the word "dance": is it a system or a process?

You can think about the most complex and simplest systems in nearly the same way, indicating the universality of systems thinking. By grasping it, you will save significant mental energy and be able to navigate complex situations and projects more swiftly.
