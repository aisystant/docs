title: Complex Systems

We can discuss complex systems by considering the relationships within their composition. At the beginning of the section, we gave an example using a cocktail. However, a system can manifest as a **system**, consisting of spatially separated 4D objects. For instance, a water rescue system, which includes lifeguards, boats, life rings, and so forth. Such systems, unlike an airplane or a motor, we will refer to as complex systems. 

**Complex systems are defined by the objects included within the given complex system**. At the same time, we do not refer to complex systems as processes; they are different types of concepts. You cannot conflate them, just as you cannot confuse types like "furniture chair" and "color red," "cities" and "countries," "roles" and "positions," etc.

When we say **"process,"** it means that we stop considering the system and shift our focus^[Just as we shift attention from describing to embodying or documenting the system.] and now concentrate on the interactions between different systems. We can also consider a process happening within a system.

Processes are usually referred to by verbs or verbal nouns. For example, the process of "hammering a nail." It's quite difficult to observe the process of hammering a nail. Processes themselves, as changes, are invisible (remember, the process of movement is noticeable through the system). But we can imagine a process as a list of physical objects involved in it. So "hammering a nail" consists of the nail, hammer, board, and carpenter.

It's a bit more challenging to identify objects in a process if a stone serves as the hammer, a wall as the board, and you yourself play the role of the carpenter, often forgetting to include yourself in the process.

Yet this reduction of "processes" to material objects that alter one another during interaction remains a reliable method for identifying works, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behaviors in the physical world. However, it's crucial not to forget that **a process is not a system,** **but the interaction of systems**. This interaction is what truly matters. For example, the word "performance" indicates that an action (process) is taking place, involving actors, music, and a stage. Meanwhile, the complex system is the theater, which encompasses numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, **seek actions not indicated by verbs,** **but rather objects indicated by nouns** that behave in interactions and exhibit their behavior in the world. Although it's not always possible to find precisely meaningful names, they might not exist in the culture, or they are reserved for other types. For example, consider what the word "dance" means: is it a system or a process?

You can think about the most complex and simplest systems in more or less the same way, demonstrating the universality of systems thinking. By understanding it, you'll significantly conserve cognitive energy and be able to navigate the most complex situations and projects more quickly.
