title: 'Execute Modeling: 2.4. System Implementation, Description, and Documentation'

Please review the examples in the first rows of the table. If needed, revisit the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the presented data can apply to a wide range of situations; you only need to provide at least one example. The main focus is to avoid methodological errors.

For your current or past projects (or projects of your friends that you are familiar with), fill out the table by specifying at least five system implementations, descriptions of this system, and documents describing this system.

It is sufficient to provide one example of a description and one document containing this description for each system implementation, but you can include more: one implementation may have many descriptions, and one description may be documented across various media/in different documents. Only write the names of the requested items in the table; there is no need to include full texts and diagrams.

If necessary, make notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the “Notes” column, you can jot down your insights that arise while applying thinking through writing as you fill out the table.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.**
