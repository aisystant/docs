Here is the translation of your text while adhering to the specified guidelines:

---

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the presented data can apply to a wide range of situations; you need to provide at least one example. The key is to avoid making obvious mistakes.

For your current or past projects (or projects of your acquaintances), complete the table by listing at least five embodiments of the system, descriptions of this system, and documents containing descriptions of this system.

It is sufficient to provide one example of a description and a document containing this description for each system embodiment, but you can include more: a single embodiment can have many descriptions, and one description can be documented across various media/in a variety of documents. Only write down the names of the requested items in the table; there is no need to include full texts and diagrams!

If necessary, make notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can record insights that arise when applying thinking through writing during the process of filling in the table.

**Locate the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
