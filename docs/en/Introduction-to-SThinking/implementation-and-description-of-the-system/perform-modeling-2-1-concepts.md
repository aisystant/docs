title: 'Perform Modeling: 2.1. Concepts'
---

Write down the five or more concepts from this section that stood out to you the most, and next to each, list the concepts they are most closely connected with in your view. Other concepts can come from your current worldview, meaning you don't have to include only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For instance, try explaining these concepts in simple terms, providing examples from your own experience, connecting different concepts together, or explaining their importance.

**Locate the relevant assignment by its number in your modeling workspace and complete all its tasks**.
