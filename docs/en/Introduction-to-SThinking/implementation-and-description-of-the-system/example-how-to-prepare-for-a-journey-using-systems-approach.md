title: 'Example: How to Prepare for a Journey Using Systems Approach'

I'm planning another trip. I've decided to travel light, so I'm taking a small carry-on suitcase. There's no room for extra items, so I need to bring only the essentials. In the process of selecting items, a methodological example emerged: how to explain several systems thinking concepts.

**What should we consider?** We'll be talking about different types of objects—functional and physical.

An item or thing can be viewed from a functional perspective, where its function is important to us. Alternatively, we may need to consider its physical characteristics and see it in reality.

For my trip, I'll need shorts and swim trunks. We usually don't realize which objects we're dealing with. But even if we don't distinguish between the concepts of a "functional object" and a "physical object," we can still make the right decision in this everyday example. However, in creating complex systems, differentiating these two concepts will be extremely useful. This is the essence of systems thinking.

**Let's start packing.** "Shorts" and "swim trunks" at the packing stage are considered functional objects, rather than specific physical ones. Shorts and swim trunks have different functions, which is the most important thing to understand in the design process.

Right now, I'm planning the trip and the necessary systems that will be used. So, I think of systems as functional objects: what I will need (functional objects) to be equipped with everything necessary and to perform different roles.

When modeling the future, I primarily think about functional objects.

**Let's set some constraints.** Next, due to the size of the suitcase, I decide that I can only take one specific physical item (physical object) that will serve as shorts or swim trunks depending on the situation.

Not every item can fulfill both roles simultaneously (role being synonymous with a functional object). But luckily, I found just the thing: long blue swim trunks-shorts by Boss. They will perform the functions of both shorts and swim trunks. These are what I’ll take on the trip. Now, in different situations, I'll use a specific physical object—long swim trunks-shorts.

**Understanding how concepts work.** Items and things around us are named with the words commonly accepted in society. In culture, it's often customary to name items based on their primary functional use.

We can say that things called "shorts" and "swim trunks" have inherited names from the functions of the corresponding functional objects. For example, shorts evolved from cropped pants, and an airplane is an object whose main function is to enable flight.

**Practicing systems thinking.** A valuable skill for a systems thinker is to distinguish the context of using the words "shorts" and "swim trunks." In each statement, you can track whether it refers to functional objects or specific physical instances (objects, things).

For example, consider these two statements: "I think I will need shorts on the trip" and "I'll take these blue shorts." In both sentences, the word "shorts" is used, but in the first sentence, it is a functional example, while in the second, it is physical.

This skill, among many others in systems thinking, will be especially useful when dealing with systems in your work projects.
