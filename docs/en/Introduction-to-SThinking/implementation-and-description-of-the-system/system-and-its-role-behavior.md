title: System and Its Role Behavior
---

**We have already examined the function of a system as the desired action or **role behavior** of the system. This desired action is assigned by people; in other words, systems do not choose their functions on their own. People value not so much the thing itself (the material object) but its function. Stakeholders appreciate a system for its function, although the general public often does not see the difference.

**Systems concept*** is a specific consideration and discussion of a function that someone needs, and **the construction** that best fits the execution of this function. More about this distinction will be discussed in the following sections of the course.

**The role behavior of a system is the way the system performs its functions and interacts with the environment**, following a specific role. In systems thinking, a system is viewed as a "role object" that actively modifies its environment while performing its function.

In simpler terms, a system plays its part in a "play" or "game," where its actions and methods of functioning are defined by its role. For example, if youâ€™re a visitor in a pizzeria, you follow specific actions like ordering a pizza and paying for it. If you start asking for sandals at a pizzeria, the staff will step out of their usual role to figure out what's going on, as you've disrupted the role structure.

The main idea is that **roles and methods of operation must be aligned**: first, we determine what needs to change in the target system's environment, then we choose how to do it, and only then do we define the system's role, methodologies, and the role of the system's creators^[More on how this works can be found in the "Mantra of Systems Thinking" and "Game Metaphor" sections of the "Systems Thinking" course.]. Following this sequence helps avoid obvious mistakes and misunderstandings in projects.
