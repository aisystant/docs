title: Composition Relation

When we discuss implementation, it's crucial to understand the primary relationships in systems, known as **the part-whole relationship**, also referred to as composition or assembly relations.

Engineers often refer to this as the breakdown of a system. The essence of systems lies in **system breakdowns**. The levels of this breakdown are what we call **system levels**. A practitioner of systems thinking has a well-developed cognitive technique that allows them to deconstruct any subject area into system levels, depending on various contexts, or subjects of interest.

**Breakdowns are performed by an individual's attention in a role** or by a team; nothing is physically dismantled in the real world! If we deconstruct an elephant into its trunk, ears, legs, tail, etc., using our attention, it doesn’t mean we’ve physically removed these parts from its body. Rather, we have identified these parts in the elephant with our attention for some purpose.^[For specific objectives, such as understanding or analyzing the elephant in parts.] Moreover, we have even identified the entire elephant as part of the physical world with our attention, because we needed to focus on the elephant as a whole. We can continue to identify a group of elephants and then the savanna, where other animals live alongside the elephants. In this way, we use our attention to distinguish several system levels.

The main approach in breakdowns is **from part to whole** or **from whole to part**, **relative to 4D dimensions**. In 3D, it’s relatively straightforward: a wing and fuselage are parts of an airplane, a fuel pump is a part of an engine, which in turn is part of the airplane. If we accept that all systems exist not only in physical space but in space-time, then any discussion about different states or roles of a system becomes a discussion about parts in time. For example, an egg is simply a part of a butterfly over time—while the butterfly is in the "egg" stage, there is no other "butterfly" taking up the egg's physical space.

Thus, you can work with the states or roles of a system as separate entities, and they can receive **distinct names**. A butterfly in the "egg" stage is called an "egg." John Smith, when ill, is referred to as a "patient," with "patient" merely being a role or state of John Smith.

**Dividing a system into parts, especially when time is involved, is a complex skill.** It requires practice. One must start by understanding the concept of composition. Unfortunately, intuition often fails here. Systems thinking is counterintuitive, so guidance from an instructor can be necessary. Additionally, it's crucial to practice solving educational tasks. We will identify system levels in section 5, and in this section, try to distinguish subsystems, sub-subsystems, and supersystems within a system.
