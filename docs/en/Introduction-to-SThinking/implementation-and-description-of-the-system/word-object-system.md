title: Word, Object, System

Let's master another thinking technique and learn to differentiate between "word," "object^[Here, we are speaking about a physical object, not all objects, which can be abstract.]," and "system."

Let's take the word "hammer" as an example. In language, it's quite challenging to separate the word "hammer" from the physical object "hammer"â€”that is, the specific hammer in my hand. In Russian, these are strongly connected for us. However, if, for example, a Chinese person were to say the word "hammer" in Chinese, we would just hear a series of sounds and wouldn't even consider the object "hammer." Thus, the word is merely sounds and symbols (letters) put together. Humans use this word to name a physical or abstract object.

A word can denote a physical object that is called by that name in the culture. Usually, before this "word" appears, there is some system, and the inventor gives it a name, or the name is formed later by the culture (as a class of certain physical objects). For example, once upon a time, the phrase "automatic self-propelled carriage" or "horse-less carriage" was used, but eventually, the word "automobile" became attached to this system. Overall, it's a **cultural trend to find a short name for the system**, even though initially, the inventor used a long phrase.

A good **name for a system** **means that** **its main function is clear from the name.** Another example is an airplane or a system designed to enable flight. Often, the names of systems, roles, and subjects come from other languages. For instance, the word "chauffeur" came from French and was related to the function of "heater." Read more about this in the post "The Chauffeur and the Driver" in the AISYSTANT club^[<https://systemsworld.club/t/shofer-i-voditel/8561>].

Subsequently, the name of the system becomes associated with a specific object, or we use this invented word for certain objects. However, we must clearly understand that **the system "hammer"** **is not equivalent to** **the typical physical object "hammer"** (the one in my hand), which everyone in the culture clearly envisions. The word is the same, but the meaning differs, and in systems thinking, it's important to keep this in mind.

In the first case, we pay attention to the fact that we **need a system to perform the function of driving nails.** Incidentally, this system likely would have been called a nail driver or simply an item for driving nails. Later, the short name "hammer" became established in the culture. But this role can be fulfilled by physical objects like "stone" or "microscope." Of course, the best performer for this role is the typical physical object "hammer."^[In fact, this item was invented for this purpose, and was later named with this word. Therefore, people no longer need to understand what's being talked about in a specific case. However, a systems thinker must possess the skill of identifying words in context. Incidentally, for a specific working role, like a manager, there will always be both good and bad performers.]

Conveniently naming a specific type of object that usually performs a particular function is certainly useful, and culture usually handles this well. That's why it can be **challenging to separate** **the word, physical object, and system** "hammer." But a systems thinker must easily understand this from context in any project. The thing is, with a hammer, everything is clear, but when it comes to complex work projects, it might not be as easy. Therefore, we start understanding with the example of a "hammer," and then apply the same thinking techniques in work projects.

When you manage this separation, it will become easier for you to understand what physical and functional objects are, what a system is, and other concepts of systems thinking.
