title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts
---

In this section, we discussed the cognitive technique of distinguishing between embodiment, description, system documentation, and the function of a system. You could say that any description is a description of a system. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The main relationships in systems are the "part-whole" relationships, also known as composition/assembly relationships. Divisions are made exclusively through attention; nothing in the physical world is specifically broken into parts!

Every system has a function or role behavior needed by certain external project roles. Systems are usually named according to their primary purpose or main function.

Complex systems are defined through the objects included in a given complex system. However, we do not refer to complex systems as processes; these are different types of concepts.

**Main Concepts**: physical world, mental space; system description, embodiment of the system, System Documentation; method of description; functional object=role object, role behavior=function=purpose in the environment (system's purpose); physical object=role executor=module; naming of systems; "part-whole" relationship=composition/assembly relationship, systems decomposition, systems levels; complex system, process.
