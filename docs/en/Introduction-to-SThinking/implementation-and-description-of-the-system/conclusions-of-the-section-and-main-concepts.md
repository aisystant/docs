title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts
---

In this section, we discussed the thinking mastery technique of distinguishing between the embodiment, description, documentation, and function of a system. It can be said that any description is a description of a system. A system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The primary relationships in systems are "part-whole" relationships, also known as composition/assembly relationships. Divisions are made exclusively through attention; nothing in the physical world is specifically broken into parts!

Every system has a function or role behavior, which is necessary for certain external project roles. Systems are generally named based on their primary purpose or their main function.

Complex systems are defined through the objects included in the given complex system. At the same time, we do not refer to complex systems as processes, as they are different types of concepts.

**Main Concepts**: physical world, mental space; system description, system embodiment, System Documentation; description method; functional object=role object, role behavior=function=purpose in the environment (system's purpose); physical object=role executor=module; system naming; "part-whole" relationship=composition/assembly relationship, systems concept regarding division, system levels; complex system, process.
