title: Description and Realization of the System
---

In Aisystant, the course "Rational Work" **teaches how to distinguish between the physical world and mental space in speech or writing**. This course also trains individuals to connect abstract reasoning to the physical world. While people cannot function without mental concepts, as they facilitate communication, it's crucial not to lose sight of the physical world objects behind words and symbols. "Losing touch with reality" is especially discouraged in project activities, as it can complicate the creation of successful systems.

For instance, an insolvency administrator during enterprise bankruptcy may mistakenly believe that their goal is to enter data about the liquidation into the register. However, this entry is merely information that confirms all remaining enterprise assets have been distributed to creditors. These assets exist in the physical world; they are the administrator's objective and their system. The register entry merely describes this system. Therefore, in any activity, **one must not confuse the system with its description**. This cognitive skill and habit needs practice. But first, one must have a solid understanding of the concepts of "system embodiment" and "system description."

In systems thinking, the concepts of "**system embodiment**" and "**system description**" relate to different realms. "Embodiment" refers to an object in the material and physical world, while "description" emphasizes that the discussion involves mental space, i.e., the essence of the system rather than its flesh.

In this context, the term "system embodiment" may seem tautological because when saying "system," we inherently understand it to mean a physical object realized in reality. However, "embodiment" is intentionally used alongside "system" to contrast it with the phrase "system description." Often, when discussing a "system embodiment," the conversation also involves the "system description,"^[Thus, you can use simply the term "system" without "embodiment." But if you wish to highlight that you are separately considering a system and its description, you can use the terms "system embodiment" and "system description."]. 

The embodiment of a system could be an individual **system as a physical object**. For example, this "Blue Lagoon" cocktail in hand or this specific pencil. These objects are physically present in the world, existing in four dimensions (4D): length, width, height, and time^[Note that this is not an abstract chair or car, which aren't tied to physical space and time.].

When we describe a system, we use terms that define its **characteristics, properties, actions, features, behavior, states**, and so on. Consider terms like color, price, height, weight, desires, etc. These words differ from terms like "car," "table," or "watch," which denote physical objects.

To describe a system, certain **methods of description** are necessary^[For more details on this concept, see section 6.]. Each characteristic requires its own worldviews, theories, and disciplines. If you need to describe a car's price, understanding pricing practices (description methods) is essential. If describing a business for a shareholder, understanding financial reporting under IFRS or US GAAP and the associated technology for preparing financial documents (such as SAP) is imperative.

System descriptions are inherently abstract. This concept is necessary to emphasize the substantive aspect of the system under discussion. However, descriptions can be linked to the physical world, focusing on form. This requires looking at the information medium that will contain the system descriptions. Thus, we end up discussing **System Documentation**^[When referring to a "system description," context will dictate what it means: either the description itself or "a document with the description." The term "description" can often refer to both.].

Using the term "System Documentation" means focusing primarily on the physical medium that contains the system description^[When you hear or read "description," determine from the context whether it refers to just a "description" or a "document with a description." Often, "description" can mean both.]. For example, a menu serves as the documentation for the "cocktail" system. It contains the cocktail's description: ingredients, price, photo, and more.

**Documentation is often created using tools (technologies)** that implement a specific discipline used to describe the system. For example, "Financial Statements per US GAAP" documentation is prepared using the SAP IT system.

Thus, the ability to understand the differences between the concepts of embodiment, description, and system documentation, as well as to identify these concepts in one's life, is a crucial cognitive skill. Without the skill to fluently differentiate these concepts, further study of systems thinking will be impossible.
