Let's talk more in-depth about documentation. You already know that **System Documentation is a description of the system recorded on some physical medium.** This can be a parts catalog, a product brochure, a computer system model, or text on paper. Notice how the words^[Now always pay attention to the words of your conversation partner. For example, how often they use terms from the physical world or the mental realm. Or what they want to discuss right now: a substantive question, the form of presentation, or something else?] suggest the following: they list objects from the physical worldâ€”a brochure, a model in a computer, paper. But when talking about media, we haven't addressed the content of the description. This can be seen, read, heard, etc. It characterizes the system based on various parameters^[What parameters? Those that interest the many stakeholders.].

The concepts of "embodiment," "description," and "documentation" are necessary to avoid getting lost in discussions about the system. These concepts help focus attention and allow for discussing each aspect separately, rather than mixing everything up^[Our brains lack the processing power to discuss the system from multiple angles simultaneously. Additionally, these concepts can be of interest to different roles.]. Let's consider an example. **A system can be a human being as a biological entity.** They are an object of the physical world and are "in the flesh," meaning the "human" system is literally embodied in reality. There are numerous descriptions, such as height, weight, hair color, and skin tone, among others. There is also a description in the form of a last name, first name, and (often omitted) middle name.

When we speak about descriptions, we understand they don't exist in the physical world. When naming a person, we refer to the description of that person. It resides in the mental space. However, there is also System Documentation: birth certificates, passports, international passports, driver's licenses, etc. These documents contain specific descriptions of the "human" system. **Documents exist in the physical world and contain descriptions**^[Substantive characteristics of the system.]** that are of interest to certain project roles.** For example, a driver's license is of interest to a traffic officer. If these interests did not exist, neither would the descriptions, and there would be no need to create such documentation.

The same division into the embodiment, description, and documentation of the system applies to inanimate objects. Take a milkshake, for example. On one hand, the drink itself in the physical world is the embodiment of the system. This milkshake has various descriptions: name, recipe, etc. Additionally, there is documentation of the system on a paper medium that includes the name and ingredients, and there's documentation in the form of a menu with a photo and price of the drink.

**Descriptions refer to specific characteristics or properties of the system.** This information does not exist in the real world. For example, you can't say that a person's age of "42 years" exists somewhere in the physical world and possesses its own length-width-height-time (4D dimensions). You can point to a person, but that would be the embodiment of the system. You can point to the number "42" in the physical world only if it is located on a specific information medium.

Thus, **documentation can be presented** in the form of an IT model, diagram, table, text on paper, or in a computer. When we say "documentation," we focus on the information medium. It remains the focus of discussion until the words "embodiment" or "description" appear.

**Descriptions can be informal or formal.** Most people do not realize the importance of formal descriptions and are content with informal ones. In complex projects, when working with multiple interests, formal descriptions created by a specific method and recorded on a medium are essential. They aid in clarifying the subject of interest because, by starting to create descriptions, you better understand the stakeholders. Informal descriptions often remain in people's heads and may not follow a formal description method. Much of what is simply envisioned in the mind is forgotten.

As we have previously stated, formal descriptions of subjects of interest are created using specific **description methods (practices).** A description method includes a minimum of concepts and principles. This is covered in the "Rational Work" course. Systems thinking relies on knowledge of ontologics (ontology and logic), so when creating a systems description, it's necessary to be able to read and create various system models and to work with models understandable to computers.

To create a successful system, certain role interests must be satisfied. This satisfaction occurs through creating models that align with the selected subjects of interest in the system. That's why it's so crucial for us to delve into system descriptions. **To actualize a successful system in reality**, **we must work with the system's descriptions.** These depend on the subjects of interest to project roles.

**Most of you work with numerous system descriptions.** Try making a list in tables on modeling documents you've created, participated in creating, or documents made by colleagues that you use in your work. Connect each document to the system it describes. Also, think about what systems are described in your company's development strategy or in other similar documents.

Even though modern office workers deal with descriptions, it is crucial not to lose sight of the physical world. Always look for the embodiments of the system. Systems thinking is primarily about the physical world, even though it deals with descriptions: "**descriptions are nothing, but what they describe is everything!**". All descriptions are made solely to change the physical world!
