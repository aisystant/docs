Let's delve deeper into System Documentation. You already know that **System Documentation refers to the depiction of a system on some physical medium.** This could come in the form of a parts catalog, a product brochure, a computer-based system model, or a text on paper. Notice that the words suggest^[Always pay attention to the words of your conversation partner. Note, for instance, how often they use terms from the physical world or the mental realm. Additionally, consider what they're looking to discuss: a substantive question, the format of content presentation, or something else entirely.] the following: various objects from the physical world are enumerated here—brochure, computer model, paper. However, when discussing mediums, we've said nothing about the content of the depiction. This content can be seen, read, heard, etc. It characterizes a system based on various parameters^[Based on what parameters? On those relevant to numerous stakeholders.].

The terms "representation," "depiction," and "documentation" are necessary to prevent confusion when reasoning about a system. These concepts help manage focus, allowing each aspect to be discussed separately rather than jumbled together^[Our brain lacks the computational power to discuss a system from several angles simultaneously. Moreover, these concepts may interest different roles.]. Let's break down an example. **A system can be a person as a biological entity.** They are an object of the physical world, existing "in the flesh," meaning the "human" system is literally embodied in reality. There are numerous descriptions, such as height, weight, hair and skin color, and so on. There’s also a description in the form of last name, first name, and middle name.

When we talk about descriptions, we understand they are not in the physical world. Using a person's name refers to their description, residing in the mental space. There is also System Documentation: birth certificate, passport, international passport, driver's license, and so forth. These documents contain a specific description of the "human" system. **Documents exist in the physical world and provide descriptions**^[Substantive characteristics of the system.]**, which are of interest to certain project roles.** For example, a driver's license interests a traffic inspector. Without these interests, there would be no descriptions, and no need to create such documentation.

The same division into representation, description, and documentation can be applied to inanimate objects. Take a milkshake, for instance. On one hand, this beverage's physical presence in the world is the system's representation. It has various descriptions: name, recipe, etc. There is also system documentation on paper, listing its name and ingredients, as well as a menu with photos and the drink's price.

**Descriptions refer to** **specific** **characteristics or properties of a system.** This information doesn't exist in the real world. For instance, you can't say a person's age "42 years" exists somewhere in the physical world with its own length-width-height-time (4D dimension). You can point at a person, but that would be the system's representation. You can reference the number "42" in the physical world only if it’s on a specific information medium.

So, **documentation can be presented** as an IT model, diagram, table, text on paper, or in a computer. Thus, when we say "documentation," we emphasize the information medium. This remains a discussion priority until the words "representation" or "description" come into play.

**Descriptions can be informal or formal.** Most people don’t realize the importance of formal descriptions and settle for only informal ones. In complex projects, where we handle myriad interests, formal descriptions—created through specific methodologies and placed on a medium—are essential. They help clarify the subject of interest, as it leads to a better understanding of stakeholders when creating descriptions. Informal descriptions often linger in people’s minds without a formal method backing them. Much of what’s merely thought out can be forgotten.

As previously stated, formal descriptions of subjects of interest are crafted through specific **description methodologies** **(practices)**. These methodologies encompass a conceptual minimum and principles. This topic is covered in the "Rational Work" course. Systems thinking relies on knowledge of ontologic (ontology and logic), necessitating the ability to read and create various models of a system, and to work with models understood by computers.

To create a successful system, specific roles' interests must be satisfied. This satisfaction occurs through developing models that address chosen subjects of interest in the system. This is why understanding system descriptions is so vital. **To manifest a successful system in reality,** **working with system descriptions is essential.** They depend on project roles' subjects of interest.

**Most of you work with a multitude of system descriptions.** Try drafting tables during modeling to list documents you create, participate in creating, or documents made by colleagues that you utilize in your work process. Align each document with the system it describes. Additionally, consider which systems are described in your enterprise's development strategy or any similar document.

Although modern office workers deal with descriptions, we mustn't lose sight of the physical world. Always seek the system's embodiment. Systems thinking is primarily about the physical world, even though it deals with descriptions: "**descriptions are nothing, but what they describe is everything!**" All descriptions are made solely to bring change to what is described in the physical world!
