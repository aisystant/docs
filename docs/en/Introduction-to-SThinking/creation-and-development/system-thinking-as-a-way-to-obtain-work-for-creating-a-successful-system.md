### Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

This subsection concludes the substantive discussion of the systems concept of thinking, so here we will compile everything covered in previous sections. It is especially important to understand how the team utilizes the 3x3 Table in project activities.

As you already know, this table draws the team's attention to the most crucial aspects to consider during project activities.

The table is built on the connection between **areas of interest of the three main systems and the three main roles.** Each cell in the 3x3 Table contains various subjects of interest related to different systems, lists roles and methods, and provides examples of work products (documentation) that should be developed while working on the target system.

While working on the target system, it's important to keep in mind and consider several systemic levels and chains of creation. You can work with "our system," which might be a subsystem of the target system or the creator system. Or, within your operations, it's necessary not just to create or develop the target system but also to implement organizational changes in the organization.

There are many teams that create and develop successful systems (both target systems and creator systems) without fully utilizing a systems approach. The fact is, creating and developing systems ultimately involves executors/performers handling specific tasks with resources. These tasks don't necessarily have to be defined systemically. For instance, it can be done through experience, trial and error, and so on. Moreover, **if you have ample resources, you'll create a successful system anyhow:** you can always attract top agents, acquire the best tools, and verify your hypotheses multiple times. This is why large companies and market leaders have a better chance of survival than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one way to accomplish tasks, but it's far from the only one. However, applying systems thinking offers a chance to gain an edge over leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in shorter timeframes and with smaller budgets, though not with absolute certainty. Nevertheless, the techniques of systems thinking help achieve necessary tasks through systems modeling, as outlined in the 3x3 Table. It's essentially a checklist to ensure nothing is overlooked when working on the creation and development of the target system.

We don't talk about 100% success probability because, firstly, this checklist contains only hypotheses. For example, hypotheses about customer dissatisfaction or a system architecture hypothesis. Therefore, you will still need to cycle through testing these hypotheses, and this applies to all the cells of the 3x3 Table. Secondly, to create the appropriate work products, applied methods and professional executors/performers will be required. Nonetheless, **systems thinking provides fundamental clarity** regarding where to start when faced with something new and complex.

Ultimately, systems thinking explains why certain tasks are necessary, what results are expected, and sets the trend for subsequent actions. All this **reduces chaos in your mind and boosts confidence in your actions.**
