title: 'Perform the Simulation: 7.6. Role, Method, and Work Product'
---

Here is the translation following the guidelines:

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work product, it's sufficient to provide an example of one role. Including full names is optional, or you can mention well-known figures. If your expertise lacks breadth to select the appropriate words and labels (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance or consult knowledgeable experts. Write down the last names of three of your colleagues and align them with project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Then, list at least three of your project roles, methods, and work products.

If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a question you plan to ask in support chat, or jot down a thought for future preparation.
