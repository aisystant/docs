Review the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. For the specified work product, it is sufficient to provide an example of one role. There's no need to include full names, or you can mention well-known individuals. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the right words and labels (names), feel free to use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with familiar experts.

List the last names of three of your colleagues and match them with the project roles they play in a specific work or personal project. Then, write down at least three of your own project roles, methods, and work products.

Create notes for further elaboration if necessary. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its tasks.**
