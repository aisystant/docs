title: Why and How to Explain What Systems Thinking Is
---

You have probably heard of the famous quote by Ernest Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics and Nobel Prize winner: “If a scientist cannot explain to the cleaning lady who tidies up his laboratory what he is doing, then he himself doesn’t understand what he is doing.”

This quote raises an important question: why should you be able to explain systems thinking to everyday people, like colleagues, children, or your followers? Isn’t it just a waste of time and effort?

**The answers to these questions continue the educational programs** in any subject and, consequently, your own self-development as a system. No matter what you study or practice—be it physics, systems thinking, or AI—you first focus on theory and later get more involved in practice. You may feel you know many systems concepts, principles, and thinking techniques. Yet, with each visit back to the theory, you view what was seemingly studied with a fresh perspective and notice something unusual, deepening your understanding.

When you explain complex concepts to others, you revisit what you have learned and **test your knowledge in terms of explaining certain work or life situations**^[It's like testing your neural network to explain the world since systems thinking is also a worldview—a way to see the world.]. By explaining what systems thinking is to others, you:

* continue layering your knowledge (it's like adding a second coat of paint), as they say, “If you want to understand something better, explain it to someone else”;
* gain a better meaning of your activities, enhancing your autonomy and understanding of why you invest so much time in complex knowledge. This means you're constantly grounding your knowledge;
* start creating like-minded individuals among your family and colleagues^[You will especially feel that your loved ones share a similar worldview.], enabling future collaboration on professional and personal projects;
* engage in enlightening others and making the world a better place by posting about your experiences on social media and promoting systems thinking.

Here's one **explanation of systems thinking as a worldview** that you can adopt.

When you enter an apartment, you quickly get your bearings. You possess specific terminology that helps you notice things or ask necessary questions. You know what a kitchen is, how a bath differs from a shower, what communal living means, and so on. Thus, whether you are a buyer, seller, tenant, or guest, manager, or handyman, you can make informed decisions.

Similarly, systems thinking helps you quickly understand any human activity, grasping how things relate to one another. For example, you can identify metaphorical “sellers,” “real estate agents,” or “burglars” in any scenario. Systems thinking is a "lens" through which you can view work projects, your enterprise, or your life. Not just view, but also change the world.

This "lens" or worldview doesn’t develop in just a couple of months. Our brains need time to form new connections. However, by studying relevant courses and applying this knowledge practically, you can develop systems thinking faster compared to the overall time unwittingly spent learning real estate market knowledge. Even if you know a lot about this market, it's likely not as much as a professional. Many are familiar with their work activities, but that doesn’t equate to having a systems view.

Fluent systems thinking functions just like any worldview. For instance, when you enter a new enterprise, everything makes sense, just like in an apartment. But knowing about apartment matters doesn't mean you can easily renovate or install new windows. Similarly, systems thinking is not a panacea; practical methods are also needed. However, you will know which suppliers to call for new windows and who to contact for a ventilation system. Every enterprise activity is conceptually clear to you, like any apartment.

Many adults likely understand how to renovate an apartment and what to start with: what to do first, what to follow with. If need be, each could easily write three to five paragraphs about what to pay attention to in any apartment or how to renovate one. Likewise, a systems thinker knows where to look first, and through the main AISYSTANT program, learns how to improve any system and activity. They become a director of development for themselves, their family, or their team, and potentially a leader in their community or society.

I hope you can better understand the brief description in the first subsection "How Systems Thinking Assists in Work Activities." Based on this text and your experience, you will be able to create your **personal explanations of what systems thinking is.** In doing so, you will continuously enhance your mastery in systems thinking.
