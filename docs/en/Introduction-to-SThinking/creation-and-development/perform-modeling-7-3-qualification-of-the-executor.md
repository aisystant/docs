Translation:

Recall your last three conversations with colleagues and fill in the table. Rate the proficiency on a ten-point scale, where 0 means "completely lacks the method, cannot do anything," and 10 means "masters the method better than anyone in the world, can do everything with this method with consistently excellent results."

Make notes for further development, if necessary.

**Locate the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.**
