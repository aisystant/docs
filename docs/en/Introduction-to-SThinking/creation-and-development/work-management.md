title: Work Management

Work management differs from practice management. **Practice management** focuses on the methods (practices) that will be used to create all work products according to the 3x3 Table. It's important to understand which practices are necessary, implement them in the organization, and monitor their relevance. In contrast, work management is based on the established practice management.

**Work management** (also known as operation management) involves allocating resources to implement plans on time and within budget. This introduces **work phases**, which, as you know, differ from logical stages where practices follow one another in sequence^[For example, a wall is first prepared and plastered before it is painted, rather than the other way around.]. However, detailed planning for all phases is now rarely used because life quickly makes adjustments. Only the upcoming phase is planned in detail, and all subsequent phases are considered with significant assumptions, as the situation will likely change considerably when work on these phases begins.

Practice management is an engineering discipline, requiring a good understanding of engineering work practices. Work management, however, is purely a managerial discipline, requiring a solid knowledge of **operational management.**

Work management abstracts from the engineering essence of operations, for instance, from systems modeling, the results of which are generally presented in the 3x3 Table. All work within project activities or at the enterprise level is inevitably linked to areas of interest.

Knowledge about how work is performed is not particularly necessary for an operational manager. **The manager's goal is to achieve the fastest and cheapest completion of work to deliver a work product based on systems modeling.** For this, managerial methods are used. For example, if the productivity of an assembly line is insufficient, the manager decides to add more machines. The specifics of what type of processing the machine performs or whether it could be done using another method and tools are not his concern. He addresses the bottleneck with a managerial approach. Conversely, finding another practice to solve the productivity issue belongs to practice management or a project in organizational development, managed by a development director^[Any problem can be addressed with engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For example, one might change the method of work, add resources and performers, or choose not to solve the problem and focus on another.]

**Work management encompasses various practices, such as project management, process management, and case management.** Each practice is characterized by its own set of interests and the corresponding method of work flow description. Their main objective is to accelerate the work flow while minimizing its cost.

**Project management** involves upfront planning, which includes milestones, resources, start and end times, production standards, etc. For example, project management is useful in building construction, where the design office has prepared the project documentation. Builders simply need to carry out the necessary work according to certain phases.

**Process management** involves uniform work, a typical sequence of steps usually dictated not so much by a plan but by regulations. Process management can be applied during the operation phase of the same building. It includes visible processes like cleaning, trash disposal, scheduled maintenance, and so on.

**Case management** is a more modern way of managing work. A case refers to a situation, circumstance, or undertaking requiring a series of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject on which actions are performed. Examples include a person, legal case, or insurance instance. A case depends on the evolving circumstances as it's impossible to foresee all work in advance. Case management is conveniently used during the life cycle stages of ideation and design, where planning is difficult, yet managing work is necessary. Here, the concept of a case is highly beneficial.
