title: Management of Operations
---

Management of tasks differs from management of practices. Practice management focuses on the methods (practices) used to create all work products according to the 3x3 Table. It's essential to identify necessary practices, implement them within the organization, and monitor their relevance. Conversely, task management builds upon established practice management.

**Task Management** (also known as operation management or operations management) involves allocating resources to execute plans within deadlines and budgets. Here, work phases emerge, which, as you might know, differ from logical stages where practices follow one another^[For example, wall cleaning and plastering occur before painting, not the other way around.]. However, detailed planning for all phases is rare these days, as life quickly changes plans. Detailed planning is done only for the upcoming phase, with subsequent phases considered with broad assumptions, as the situation is likely to change significantly by the time work on those phases begins.

Practice management is an engineering discipline requiring knowledge of engineering work practices. Task management, on the other hand, is purely a managerial discipline requiring a strong understanding of **operational management.**

Task management abstracts away from the engineering essence of operations, i.e., from systems modeling, whose results are generally represented in the 3x3 Table. All tasks within project activities or at the enterprise level are, in some manner, connected to areas of interest.

Knowledge about how tasks are performed is not particularly necessary for the operations manager. **The manager's goal is** **to achieve** **the swiftest and most cost-effective task completion** **to obtain a work product based on systems modeling**. Managerial methods are used for this. For example, if the productivity of an assembly line is insufficient, the manager decides to add a few more machines. It's not important to them what processing the machine performs or if it could be done using another method and tools. They address the bottleneck with a managerial approach. Seeking another practice to solve the same productivity issue, however, falls under practice management or organizational development projects, managed by a development director^[Any problem can be solved using engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For instance, one might change the working method, add resources and executors, or choose to focus on another problem instead.].

**Task management encompasses various practices such as project management, process management, and case management.** Each practice is characterized by its own set of interests and corresponding method for describing the workflow. Their shared primary goal is to accelerate the workflow while minimizing costs.

**Project Management** involves preliminary (up-front) planning, which includes milestones, resources, start and end times, production rates, etc. Project management is well-suited for building construction when a design office has prepared project documentation. Builders simply need to carry out the necessary work in specified phases.

**Process Management** consists of uniform tasks and a typical sequence of steps usually determined more by regulations than by a plan. Process management is useful during the operational phase of the same building. Processes include cleaning, waste removal, scheduled repair, etc.

**Case Management** is a more modern method of task management. A case is a situation, circumstances, or endeavor requiring a set of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject on which actions are performed. Examples include a person, a legal case, or an insurance claim. A case depends on emerging circumstances of the matter, as itâ€™s impossible to pre-plan all tasks. Case management is conveniently applied during the concept and design stages of a product lifecycle, where detailed planning is difficult, yet task management is essential. The concept of a case greatly aids in such situations.
