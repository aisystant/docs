title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects'
---

Fill in the blank lines with your main roles from work and personal projects. Provide examples of at least 10 roles. Try to cover all your work projects and areas of life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you perform well, the more likely you are living an interesting life. In the end, calculate the average level of applied proficiency. As necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a question to ask in support chat or record a thought for a future draft.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its items.**
