title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects'
---

Fill in the empty lines with your main roles from professional and personal projects. Provide at least 10 role examples. Try to cover all your work projects and all areas of life (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you perform well, the more likely you have an interesting life. At the end, calculate the average level of applied mastery. Make notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write down a question to ask in the support chat, or jot down a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
