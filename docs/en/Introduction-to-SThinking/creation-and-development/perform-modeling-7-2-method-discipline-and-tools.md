Please review the example in the first row of the table. Note that your operations involve several methods, and each method can be implemented through different tools.

Provide examples from your professional and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks that you have worked on, spending more than two hours a day. In what role did you perform these? What methods did you use, and where are these methods documented? Also, specify the best among alternative methods (considered but discarded when choosing the method to execute the taskâ€”the best of the abandoned options).

**Find the corresponding assignment in your modeling workspace by its number and complete all its tasks.**
