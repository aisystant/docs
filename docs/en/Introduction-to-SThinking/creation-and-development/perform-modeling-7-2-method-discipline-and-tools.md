Please review the example in the first row of the table. Note that your activities involve several methods, and each method can be implemented using different tools.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks you performed at work, spending more than two hours a day on them. In what role did you perform these tasks, what methods did you use, and where are these methods documented? Also, mention the best among the alternative methods (considered but discarded when choosing the way to execute the taskâ€”the best of the discarded options).

**Find the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.**
