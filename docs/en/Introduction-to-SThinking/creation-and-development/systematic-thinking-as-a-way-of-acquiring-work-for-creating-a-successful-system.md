### Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

This subsection concludes the substantive analysis of the systems thinking concepts. Here, we will compile all that we've covered in previous sections. It's particularly important to understand how the team uses the 3x3 Matrix in project activities.

As you already know, this matrix draws the team's attention to the most critical aspects that must be considered in project activities.

The table is structured around the interests of three main systems and three primary roles. Each cell in the 3x3 Matrix gathers different subjects of interest related to different systems, lists roles and methods, and provides examples of work products (documentation) that should be developed in the process of working on the target system.

When working on the target system, it's essential to consider several systemic levels and chains of creation. You might work with "our system," which could be a subsystem of the target system or the creator system. Or, your activities might need to not only create or develop the target system but also implement organizational changes within the organization.

Many teams create and develop successful systems (both target systems and creator systems) without fully utilizing the systems approach. The creation and development of systems ultimately involve performing specific tasks by executor agents using resources. These tasks don't necessarily have to be defined in a systemic way. For example, they can be derived from experience, trial and error, etc. Moreover, if you have plenty of resources, you will inevitably create a successful system: you can always hire the best agents, buy the best tools, and test your hypotheses as often as needed. That's why large companies and market leaders have a better chance of survival than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one way to achieve tasks, but it is far from the only method. However, applying systems thinking provides an opportunity to compete with leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in a shorter time and with a smaller budget. Although the likelihood is certainly not 100%, the techniques of systems thinking allow you to obtain the necessary tasks based on the systems modeling described in the 3x3 Matrix. It serves as a checklist of what should not be forgotten in the process of creating and developing the target system.

We aren't suggesting a 100% probability of success because, firstly, this checklist comprises only hypotheses. For example, there are hypotheses about customer dissatisfaction or the system's architecture. Therefore, you will still need to test these hypotheses, which applies to all cells of the 3x3 Matrix. Secondly, creating relevant work products will require applied methods and professional performers. Nevertheless, **systems thinking provides fundamental clarity** regarding where to start when faced with something new and complex.

Ultimately, systems thinking demonstrates why certain tasks must be done, what outcomes are expected, and sets the trend for subsequent actions. All of this **reduces chaos in your mind and instills confidence in your actions**.
