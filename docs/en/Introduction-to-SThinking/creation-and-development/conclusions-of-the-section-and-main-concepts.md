Creating and developing systems is considered in relation to different systems. In any project activity, numerous systems are created and developed at various systems concept levels and creation chains. At the very least, the creation and development of the target system and the systems of creation occur.

Systems thinking identifies important focal points for any activity. We begin with the area of interest of the supersystem, which means looking at the world we want to change in some way. Then, we move on to the target system and its structure. Next, we discuss the creating system, including the creation methods, roles, and resources.

The techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system using terms like organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and others.

Systems thinking can be viewed as one method of achieving tasks. The techniques of systems thinking allow us to derive the necessary tasks based on systems modeling, as described in the 3x3 Table. This functions as a checklist of what should not be forgotten in the process of working on the creation and development of the target system.

Main concepts: practice, method, organizational role, work product, discipline, tool, work management, methods management, methods manager, enterprise architect, stages, phases, organization, organizational unit, service, principle of continuity, iteration, increment, functional description of the enterprise system, modular description of the enterprise system.
