# Translation

The creation and development of systems are examined in relation to various systems. In any project activity, numerous systems are created and developed at different systemic levels and within creation chains. At a minimum, this involves the creation and development of the target system and the systems of creation.

**Systems thinking** sets important focal points for any activity. We start with the area of interest of the supersystem, meaning we look at the world we wish to change in some way. Next, we shift focus to the target system and its structure. After this, we discuss the creator-system, including creation methods, roles, and resources.

The techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the company system through notions such as organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and more.

Systems thinking can be considered one of the means to accomplish work. The techniques of systems thinking help obtain the necessary work through systems modeling, as described in the 3x3 Table. This operates like a checklist of what must not be forgotten during the work on the creation and development of the target system.
