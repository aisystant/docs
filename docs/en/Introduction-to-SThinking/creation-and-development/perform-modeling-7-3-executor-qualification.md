Text to translate:

Recall your last three conversations with colleagues and fill out the table. Rate their qualifications on a ten-point scale, where 0 is "completely unfamiliar with the method, lacks any skills," and 10 is "masters the method better than anyone else in the world, consistently achieves excellent results using this method."

If necessary, make notes for further analysis.

**In your modeling workspace, locate the corresponding assignment by number and complete all its tasks.**
