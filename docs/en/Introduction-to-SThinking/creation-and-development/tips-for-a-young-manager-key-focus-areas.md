### Introduction to Leadership Positions

Taking up the role of a leader is always a challenge, especially if you are new to managing people. You might be an excellent specialistâ€”whether a marketer, engineer, or doctor. However, the position of a leader involves not just knowledge of the field but also understanding of management. Ideally, this should be systems management^[This is why it is recommended to take our main program "Organizational Development".].

The methodology of systems management is universal, regardless of whether you're overseeing a small team of three people, a large production unit, or a multinational company. It's much easier to grasp the concepts of systems management in a small department and then apply them as you grow.

For young managers just beginning their journey in team management, it's crucial to understand two key areas of work:

* transportation operations;
* organizational development.

Of course, it's also important to understand the product (target system) your company produces, but you likely already have a good understanding of that.

Transportation operations form your foundation as the person responsible for the day-to-day workflow. Your department's work should run like clockwork. It's essential that production meets deadlines, maintains specified quality, and stays within the budget. For instance, imagine a production line where every employee knows their role and performs it flawlessly, ensuring uninterrupted operations.

Organizational development arises when it comes to advancing and modernizing your "production line." This may involve implementing new work methods, using new tools, or changing team structure to enhance efficiency. Take, for example, an IT company deciding to adopt a new work method, such as the Agile methodology, to speed up product development. A leader must not only motivate the team to accept new methods but also embody adaptability and a readiness for change.

As a leader, you must motivate your employees to work in both areas and set an example of high productivity and openness to innovations. Your task is to build a team that is ready and able to work in both transportation operations and organizational development. Typically, employees are well-versed in transportation operations but are less inclined towards changes in the production line they work on.

It's also important to work not only with your team but also with your surroundings. Your efforts towards change might impact not only your department but the entire organization. Therefore, having the support of your superiors and related departments is crucial. For instance, if you manage a marketing department and see a need to improve client process workflows, this might require collaboration with the product development, sales, and IT departments to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don't take an active role with your superior, they will focus on you and their own agenda. Not all their ideas will align with systems methodology, especially if they've not studied it, unlike you. This means you should actively participate in shaping your own agenda by proposing ideas and showing initiative. Your goal is to make your superior an ally and like-minded partner in implementing necessary changes.

In conclusion, remember that success in the leadership role depends on your ability to manage current operations and your vision and ability to carry out systems changes. Be a leader who is not afraid of challenges and is ready for continuous development, both personal and for your team.
