**Practice or Method in Systems Thinking**

In systems thinking, a practice or method can be represented as a combination of a **discipline and** the **tools** that support that discipline. Therefore, a practice implemented at an organization consists of **agents proficient in theory and** the relevant **tools, who perform specific roles**. It is important to note that individuals must learn the discipline and train to use the tools effectively.

Examples of disciplines include accounting or hairdressing theory, as well as marketing or operations management (textbooks are often written on these subjects). A discipline is learned or "placed" in one's mind, while tools are additionally mastered or trained for practical use. Tools, unlike disciplines, exist in the physical world^[A discipline is an object of the mental space but can be described on some physical medium.]. A tool is a device or object that helps create a work product. In the given examples, tools include scissors and the SAP system (1C-accounting). Tools encapsulate specific disciplines^[Thus, if you are developing a technology, it will likely be used by a role according to a particular discipline as a tool. As the developer of this tool, you must be well-acquainted with the discipline for which the role will work using this tool.].

For example, a person studying to become an accountant learns the theory of accounting and masters SAP as a tool for record-keeping. When assigned a task, they assume the role of an accountant and, using accounting practice, produce a balance sheet and an income statement. These documents are the work products, created according to the principles of accounting theory. The 1C program supports this theory and aids in generating the work products. The SAP (1C) development team must include not only programmers but also highly skilled accountants.

Incidentally, instead of SAP, tools like Excel and Word could be used. The theory remains unchanged; only the tool changes. Consider reflecting on the relationship between discipline and tools concerning your own professional methods (practices).

**Organizations as Method Combinations**

Any organization can be seen as a collection or blend of numerous methods. There are no identical people, as everyone has a different combination of genes, and similarly, there are no identical organizations. Each enterprise has its unique combination of practices, and this **distinctive set defines its competitiveness and**, consequently, **its survivability.** In their development, organizations may discover and formalize new ways of working, which can then be replicated like genes. In essence, other enterprises adopt and incorporate these best practices, leading to the literal transmission of memes.

**Organizational Methods in the 3x3 Matrix**

Each area of interest uses its own organizational methods, aligned with the 3x3 Table. This includes describing the target audience, attracting investors, architecture, or system creation description. For each cell of the 3x3 Table, appropriate methods are necessary. If your architectural practices are excellent, but your marketing practices are poor (or vice versa), then **your enterprise is unlikely to be competitive**. The 3x3 Table serves as a reminder of essential practices within an organization, allowing you also to highlight cells where you have the best market practices and those areas of interest where practices are satisfactory.

Competitiveness is achieved if your organization excels in some areas while performing satisfactorily in all other areas of interest compared to the market. If there's a significant flaw in one area, even your best practices might prove useless. Similarly, if all areas are roughly average ("four out of five"), achieving market leadership is unlikely.

**The Role of Development Directors and Organizational Designers**

Therefore, attention to organizational methods is a crucial part of the work for a **development director, specifically in the capacity of** **an organizational designer.** This role involves developing the organizational concept (as a system), defining functional roles and their interactions, and designing changes within the organization. Organizational designers may also be responsible for determining the authorities and responsibilities of organizational units and for preparing the organizational project.
