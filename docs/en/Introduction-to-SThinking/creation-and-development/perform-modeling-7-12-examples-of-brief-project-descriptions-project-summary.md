title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)'
---

Please refer to the examples in the first rows of the table. Note that similar descriptions in text have already appeared in your textbooks. The table provides a brief description made at the beginning of the project, which is then used for detailing in other descriptions as well as for ensuring all team members have a common understanding. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

If necessary, make notes for further development. It's possible that you won't create a perfect description right away and may need to revisit it several times.

**Locate the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its tasks.**
