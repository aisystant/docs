title: 'Execute Modeling: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)'
---

Text to translate:

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. Note that a similar text description might have appeared in your textbooks. The table provides a brief description, created at the beginning of the project, which is later used for detailing other descriptions and aligning the understanding of all team members. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

As needed, take notes for further development. It's possible that you won't create a strong description right away, so you may need to revisit it multiple times.

**Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
