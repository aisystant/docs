### Terms "Stage" and "Phase" in the Context of Time

The concepts of "stage" and "phase" relate to time. However, stages are associated with methods (practices) and logical time, whereas phases are linked to tasks and physical time.

**Methods (practices)** can be **arranged sequentially** **in logical time**, and stages can be highlighted if needed. For example, when creating the "painted wall" system, we can identify methods such as puttying, sanding, painting, and drying.

From this, it's possible to define the functional parts of the organization responsible for painting the wall. In this functional consideration, we currently do not discuss when it will be done and by which agents (executors). This will be addressed when discussing tasks.

It's not always possible to identify all necessary methods initially, nor is it convenient to handle numerous practices. Therefore, they can be grouped into specific stages. Initially, one might define a "preparation" stage with puttying and sanding practices and a "painting" stage with painting, drying, and repainting practices.

When creating many systems, **universal stages** such as ideation, modeling, creation, and operation are often recognized. Within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices are identified for developing a specific target system. Consequently, substages may also be recognized.

Practices within stages^[And the stages themselves are arranged logically, as seen in the list of universal stages.] and substages are organized in a specific logical order, meaning creation typically follows modeling. However, different practices and stages may be implemented simultaneously, unlike phases, which proceed sequentially in physical time.

**The list of practices and their logical order is determined by the concept and architecture of the system.** A task must be "assigned" to each practice, similarly to how a module-structure is assigned to each system function. Each task is performed by an organizational unit, which plays a role in a practice at a certain time using some resource, resulting in a work product.

Each **phase contains a specific list of tasks, and phases follow strictly one after another in physical time.** Tasks within a phase are executed by different organizational units, either sequentially or in parallel. Phases are defined by managers who need to acquire certain work products essential for progressing to other phases.

For example, a manager might define a phase as the system sales phase, with the checkpoint being a signed contract. However, during this phase, one may go through the stages of system ideation and design, possibly even creating the first version or MVP of the system. Alternatively, it may be decided not to undertake any system development tasks until the contract is signed. Thus, managers determine which tasks are included in each phase.

**The delineation of phases depends on** **the management methods** **for tasks**, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Phases can be pre-planned or opened as needed. Tasks can be assigned to all phases in advance, using project or process management methods. Alternatively, tasks can be determined as circumstances arise, utilizing case management methods.

Tasks may be organized so that **methods that logically follow each other** **are executed simultaneously.** For example, one team might prepare a second wall while another team paints the already prepared first wall at the same time. Such a division of methods and tasks, stages and phases, allows for a convenient discussion of system creation activities.
