title: Stages and Phases
---

The concepts of "stage" and "phase" relate to time, with stages associated with methods (practices) and logical time, and phases linked to tasks and physical time.

**Methods (practices)** can be arranged **sequentially** in **logical time and**, if needed, **divided into stages**. For example, in creating the "painted wall" system, we might identify the following methods: puttying, sanding, painting, drying.

From this, we can also identify the functional parts of the organization that will be responsible for painting the wall. However, in such a functional consideration, we are not yet addressing when this will be done and by which agents (performers). We will discuss that when focusing on the tasks.

It is not always possible to immediately determine all the necessary methods, and it’s not always convenient to work with multiple practices; thus, they can be grouped into specific stages. For instance, initially, we could identify a "cleaning" stage with the practices of puttying and sanding, and a "painting" stage with the practices of painting, drying, and repainting.

In the creation of many systems, universal stages like conception, modeling, creation, and operation are often identified. Within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices are defined for the development of the specific target system. Accordingly, substages may also be identified.

Practices within stages^[And the stages themselves are arranged in a logical order, as seen in the list of universal stages.] and substages are organized in a specific logical sequence, meaning creation usually follows modeling. However, different practices and stages can occur simultaneously, unlike phases, which proceed strictly sequentially in physical time.

**The list of practices and their logical order is determined by the concept and architecture of the system**. Each practice must have an assigned task. Just like each system function has an assigned module structure. Every task is carried out by an organizational unit that plays a specific role in a given practice at a particular time using certain resources. Consequently, the organizational unit produces a work product.

Each **phase consists of a defined set of tasks, and phases follow** **strictly** **one after another in physical time**. Tasks within a phase are performed by different organizational units sequentially or in parallel. Phases are determined by managers who need to acquire specific work products without which advancing to other phases is not possible.

For example, a manager might define a phase as the selling of a system. The control point for him is the signed contract. But during this phase, besides marketing practices, one could pass through the stages of conceiving and designing the system, and perhaps even creating it—at least the first version or MVP. Alternatively, it might be decided not to execute any system creation tasks until the contract is signed. Thus, the managers determine which tasks are included in a specific phase.

**The outlining of phases depends on** **the methods** **of managing tasks**, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Work phases can be pre-planned or initiated as needed. Tasks can be pre-assigned to all phases, in which case it reflects project or process management methods. Alternatively, tasks can be determined as circumstances arise, which then involves case management or managing by cases.

Furthermore, tasks can be organized so that **methods,** which logically follow each other, **are** **performed simultaneously.** For instance, one team might be cleaning a second wall while another team paints the already cleaned first wall at the same time. This division of methods and tasks, stages and phases, allows for efficient discussion of the system creation activities.
