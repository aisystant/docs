---

Fill in the "Method" column based on the following description: "Andrew needs to give numerous product presentations over the next six months. He's knowledgeable about the product he'll be presenting, but he's somewhat uneasy about giving a public performance. He has broken down his presentation into systems levels. Help him find a method for each systems level so he can choose appropriate training courses."

If necessary, create notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write down a question to ask in the support chat or note an idea for a future draft.

**Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
