---

Text to translate:

Fill in the "Method" column based on the following description: "Andrew needs to give numerous product presentations over the next six months. He has a good understanding of the product he will be presenting, but he feels somewhat insecure about giving a public performance. He has broken down his presentation into systems levels. Help him find a method for each systems level so he can select some training courses based on them."

If necessary, create notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you may write a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all of its tasks.**
