Please familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. In the “Life Mastery” column, rate your current life mastery on a scale of 1 to 10. Life mastery is calculated as the average of the sum of thinking mastery and applied mastery. Your thinking mastery score is assessed as the average in the "Level of Thinking Mastery" table, and your applied mastery score as the average in the "My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects" table.

Indicate your current qualification with Aisystant and the year you obtained it. Also, mark the years when you earned previous qualifications to track your progress. In the column “What Needs to Be Done to Achieve the Next Qualification,” describe your self-development plans.

Note that unused knowledge tends to fade, so it’s important to regularly reaffirm your qualification. While it’s not mandatory to do so within the framework of Aisystant, we would be delighted if you shared the results of your work and personal projects on Aisystant’s public platforms. This will suffice for updating and granting a new qualification.

The highest qualification, “Actor,” implies that you can discover new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that change the world for the better, and lead a happy, successful, and interesting life.
