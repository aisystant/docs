title: Management of Practices
---

**Work Management** is entirely a managerial practice, while **practice management** is part engineering and part managerial. A practice manager should not be confused with a developer or system architect, even though they are also involved in engineering work. Their focus is on the methods and practices used by engineers of the target system, including an interest in the practices employed by developers and architects.

Practice management encompasses the **selection of necessary methods** and **organization of work around them** within an organization.

The methods manager ensures the integrity of method configurations, verifies and supports the usage of methods and tools. It is worth noting that methods managers often hold positions as CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and/or CIO (Chief Information Officer). They possess a deep understanding of practices that lead to successful system creation. The methods manager should be well-versed in those technological operations and services that will support the systems' creation to ultimately develop the target system. They also establish the logical sequence of implementing practices, including identifying stages.

Practice management answers the question, **"how does the organization operate to successfully produce a system."** This practice is engineering in the sense that it deals with practices as the functional and role behaviors of the creation system. Yet, it defines the structure of the creator system, and therefore is considered in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 Table.

In contrast to a tree or a bird^["Biological, natural systems develop independently, with their development encoded through evolution. Engineering systems, however, require engineers."], a car or a house wonâ€™t build themselves, nor will a rocket launch itself into space. Someone must specify the methods and means to achieve these tasks and in what sequence. This is the role of methods managers. The focus of the methods manager (practice manager) is on the creation systems. **Their work product is trained individuals in the practices, along with the** **technologies/tools provided to support them.**

**Do not confuse a practice manager with an enterprise architect.** The latter is concerned with the modular organization of the enterprise, determining which organizational units to divide it into, so these units can be assigned to the appropriate practices. However, the choice of practices, their completeness, and the logical sequence of their execution are the practice manager's concerns. They engage in substantive discussion about the methods of engineering work.
