title: Management of Practices
---

**Work Management** is entirely a managerial practice, whereas **Practice Management** is half-engineering and half-managerial. The practice manager should not be confused with a system developer or architect, although they engage in engineering work. Their focus is on the methods and practices of the engineers of the target system, including considering what practices developers and architects adopt.

Practice management involves the **selection of necessary methods** and the organization of work according to those methods within the organization.

A method manager ensures the integrity of the method configuration, checks, and supports the use of methods and tools. It is worth noting that the method manager often holds the position of CTO (Chief Technology Officer) and/or CIO (Chief Information Officer). They possess a deep understanding of practices that lead to the successful creation of a system. The method manager must have a solid grasp of the technological operations and services that will support the creation systems to make the target system. They also establish the logical sequence of implementing practices, identifying the stages involved.

Practice management answers the question, **"how does the organization function to produce a successful system."** This practice is engineering-related to the extent that it deals with practices as functional and role behaviors of the creation system. However, this practice defines the structure of the creator system and is thus considered in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 Table.

Unlike a tree or a bird^[Biological, natural systems develop independently; their development is driven by evolution. Engineering systems, however, require engineers' involvement.], a car and a house will not build themselves, nor will a rocket launch itself into space. Someone must specify the methods and ways to do this and in what order. This is the role of method managers. The method manager's focus is on creation systems, **their work productâ€”trained individuals in the practices, and the technologies/tools provided to them** for support.

**Do not confuse the practice manager with the enterprise architect.** The latter is concerned with the modular structure of the enterprise, determining how to divide it into organizational units to assign these units to appropriate practices. The practices themselves, their completeness, and the logical execution sequence are of interest to the practice manager. They engage in substantive discussions about engineering work methods.
