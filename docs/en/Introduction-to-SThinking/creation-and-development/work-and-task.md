title: Work and Task

**Work** refers to specific activities or behaviors of an organizational unit that occur within a defined physical timeframe. As a result of work, a work product emerges in the physical world. It can also be described as a process in which the organizational unit participates along with resources. Alternatively, within this process, the organizational unit performs a service using certain resources.

For example, John Doe using a hammer to drive nails within an allotted time and receiving payment for this constitutes work. John Doe in the role of a carpenter along with the hammer represents the organizational unit. The service is the driving of nails.

When discussing work, the primary interest lies not so much in its content^[Meaning which methods (tools) are needed to perform the work.], but in how to assemble the necessary resources for this work, as well as which organizational unit should perform these tasks to produce the required work product.

Leaders often act as **planners**, who, based on a planning method, assign tasks to executors. Their focus is on determining who among the executors should deliver a specific work product, within what timeframe, and using which resources.

Each cell in the 3x3 Table can be viewed as a collection of **tasks** that need to be completed^[Each cell of the 3x3 Table has its own planner.]. Additionally, it can be stated that the description in the subsection "How systems thinking aids in work activities" about the essence of systems thinking can be seen as high-level or typical tasks necessary in any project. For instance, it's necessary to devise a usage concept or secure investments.

**Tasks arise from systems modeling**, and to be completed, they need to be articulated as work. A task encompasses an action that must be performed within the project scope. Ideally, it should reference a method. A task becomes work when it is known:

1. Which executor (full name);
2. The timeframe;
3. The role;
4. The method (practice);
5. The resources;
6. The resultant work product.

To accurately articulate work, a planner must have access to available information on the resources (time, funds, components) and the mastery of executors.

The **enterprise architect** must segment organizational units (subdivisions) so that each can function as maximally autonomous teams. Otherwise, coordinating all work containing tasks for each cell of the 3x3 Table, along with the incremental development of the target system, will be impossible. Additionally, it should be noted that the project may involve developing numerous "our systems" for a wide variety of teams, further complicating work management. You will learn more about this in the third semester of the core program.
