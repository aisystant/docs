title: Work and Task

**Work** refers to a specific activity or behavior of an organizational unit, carried out within a designated time frame. The result of work in the physical world is a work product. This can also be described as a process involving an organizational unit along with resources. Within this process, the organizational unit performs a service using specific resources.

For instance, John Doe uses a hammer to drive nails within a set time and receives payment for this. John in the role of a carpenter, along with the hammer, constitutes the organizational unit. The service is driving nails.

When discussing work, the primary focus isn't so much on its content^[That is, what methods (tools) are needed to perform the work.] but on how to gather the necessary resources for the job, and which organizational unit should carry out the tasks to produce the required work product.

Managers often act as **planners**, who segment the work for performers based on the planning method. They are particularly interested in who among the performers, within what timeframe, and with what resources, should create a specific work product.

Each cell in the 3x3 Table can be seen as a collection of **tasks** that need to be completed^[Each cell in the 3x3 Table has its planner.]. Additionally, the description in the subsection "How Systems Thinking Helps in Work Activities" regarding the essence of systems thinking can be viewed as high-level or standard tasks that must be done in any project. For example, one needs to draft a usage concept or secure investments.

**Tasks arise as a result of systems modeling**, and to have them completed, they need to be formulated as work. A task contains an action that must be carried out within the framework of a project. Ideally, it should reference the method. A task becomes work when it is clear:

1. Who or which performer (name);
2. By when;
3. In what role;
4. Following which method (practice);
5. With what resources;
6. What work product will result.

To accurately formulate work, the planner needs accessible information on the availability of resources (time, funds, and components) and the mastery of the performers.

The **enterprise architect** must partition the organizational units (subdivisions) so that each can function as independent teams as much as possible. Otherwise, coordinating all the work containing tasks for each cell in the 3x3 Table, along with incremental development of the target system, becomes impossible. Also, note that the project may involve the development of numerous "our systems" for various teams, further complicating work management. You will learn more about this in the third semester of the main program.
