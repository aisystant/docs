title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery'
---

Text to translate:

Evaluate on a ten-point scale how well you learned thinking mastery at university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you gained from Aisystant. The total for each transdiscipline should not exceed 10 points (combining university + self-study + Aisystant).

It's okay if you're not very familiar with the contents of all the transdisciplines in the intelligence stack: try to deduce their meanings from the brief descriptions given in our course.

Please specify the year when your knowledge would have been considered state-of-the-art (for instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, that year would be the most recent date you could cite).

Your current thinking mastery assessment might take forgetting curves into account. Suppose you excelled in a discipline in 2010 and would have given yourself 10 points back then, but haven't refreshed your mastery in that area since. How many points would you retain now?

Calculate the average level of your thinking mastery as a result.

If needed, create notes for future review. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record reflections on what came to mind while filling out the table. This will help you approach the formation of your personal educational trajectory more consciously.

**Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
