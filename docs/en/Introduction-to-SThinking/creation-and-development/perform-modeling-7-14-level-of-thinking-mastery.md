title: 'Perform Simulation: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery'
---

Evaluate on a scale of ten how well you learned thinking mastery in college, how much you enhanced it through self-education, and how much you gained from Aisystant. In total, there should not be more than 10 points per transdiscipline (college + self-study + Aisystant).

It's okay if you don't fully grasp the content of all the listed transdisciplines in the intelligence stack: try to infer from the brief descriptions provided in our course.

Indicate the year in which your knowledge would be considered State-of-The-Art (SoTA). For instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, the year shouldn't be later than 1980.

When assessing your current thinking mastery, consider the forgetting curve. If you were excellent in a particular discipline in 2010 and would have given yourself 10 points then, but haven't refreshed your skills in that discipline sinceâ€”how many points would remain?

Ultimately, calculate the average level of your thinking mastery.

If necessary, create notes for future review. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down reflections that come to mind while filling out the table. This will help you approach the creation of your personal learning path more consciously.
