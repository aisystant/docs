You have studied all the sections of the course. I hope you have also completed all the assignments, including drafting and modeling tasks.

Throughout the course, you have begun to master the systems concept and techniques. You’ve also tried to apply some of them in your projects. Currently, this is a patchwork application of systems thinking, and you are likely just beginning to understand how to perceive collective activities. However, to achieve substantial progress, you will need to take courses like "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology" and fully integrate systems thinking into your work activities.

As the next step, I recommend continuing your education with the main program "Organizational Development" and ensure you undertake a work project, gradually enhancing your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to soon see you among the masters of Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website, you can visit the "Qualifications" section^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>] to explore the steps toward mastering life skills.

Having grasped the basics of systems thinking, you can begin working with your environment. Regardless of your position, I recommend involving colleagues and employees in thoroughly working through specific work documents using systems thinking concepts.

It's essential, and even necessary, to start teaching your colleagues. Firstly, collective systems thinking is far more productive than individual efforts. Secondly, the best way to learn something complex is to explain it to others. By teaching systems thinking to someone else, you gain a better understanding of it yourself. Thirdly, it is intriguing to become leaders of change, initiating and driving transformation within your team, your organization, and the world.

Why not become the person who drives systemic changes in an enterprise? Consider aiming for a position like development director or one responsible for organizational changes, including the currently popular digital transformation. The ability to initiate changes, lead them, and see them through successfully is what AISYSTANT strives to teach. It's our recipe for a happy, successful, and fulfilling life.

I am happy to answer your questions beyond the course. Feel free to contact me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. This is not goodbye. You have embarked on the journey of systems thinking, and I hope you strive to stay on this path, continuously developing and creating successful systems.
