You have completed all sections of the course. I hope you have also accomplished all the homework, including drafting templates and modeling.

Throughout the course, you have begun to learn systems techniques and concepts. You have already attempted to apply some of them in your projects. For now, this application of systems thinking is somewhat fragmented, and you are likely just starting to grasp how to view collective activities. To achieve more, you'll need to take the "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology" courses while actively incorporating systems thinking into your work activities.

As the next step, I recommend continuing with the main "Organizational Development" program and ensuring the implementation of a work project to gradually enhance your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to see you soon among the masters of Aisystant. On the AISYSTANT website, on the "Qualifications" page^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>], you can explore the steps of life mastery.

Once you have grasped the fundamentals of systems thinking, you can begin engaging with your surroundings. Regardless of your position, I encourage you to involve colleagues and staff in the detailed development of specific work documents using systems thinking concepts.

To accomplish this, it's important to start teaching your colleagues. Firstly, collective systems thinking is much more productive than individual efforts. Secondly, the best way to learn something complex is by explaining it to others. By explaining systems thinking to someone else, you enhance your own understanding. Lastly, isn't it fascinating to become leaders of change, including initiating and leading transformation within your team, company, and the world at large?

Why not be the person who can drive systemic changes within your company? Aim for a role such as Development Director or a position responsible for organizational changes, including the currently popular digital transformation. The ability to initiate, lead, and successfully execute changes is what AISYSTANT aims to teach. This is our formula for a happy, successful, and interesting life.

I would gladly answer your questions beyond the course. Always feel free to contact me on Telegram: <https://t.me/TserenTserenov>. And this isn't goodbye. You have embarked on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you will strive to stay on it, continuously and endlessly developing and creating successful systems.
