**In the Previous Sections**

We explored the core ideas and techniques of the systems approach. Now, we'll provide a general explanation of how to view any collaborative activity using systems thinking. This involves understanding how to divide the world into distinct parts and connect them, ultimately creating a successful target system without losing sight of the creator system. This understanding will aid not only in working within a team that is developing a target system or "our system" but also in interacting with other teams creating supersystems or surrounding systems, as well as subsystems or creator systems.

We'll begin with a brief description of what you've already learned in earlier sections about the systems approach. Pay particular attention to the second part of this description, where we discuss the creator system. This is a continuation of the systems approach foundation initially outlined in the subsection "Systematic Approach" in Section 1, later clarified in the subsection "Areas of Interest" in Section 5.

It's time to provide a more comprehensive description, taking into account all the systems concepts studied. The logical flow of the arguments remains unchanged. We begin with the interest area of the supersystem, looking at the world we want to change. Then we proceed to the target system and its structure, followed by a discussion of the creator system, including creation methods, roles, and resources.

**The Agent** seeks to improve the world by creating a successful system that predictably solves specific problems (dissatisfactions) for a group of people (target audiences). The promoter assumes these people will change their behavior, so it’s crucial to understand their project roles and methods, including tools. The system's success depends on satisfying the interests of external project roles (which will be played by members of a specific target audience). Therefore, it’s essential to propose the function of the operating system (role of the target system) in its environment and consider the subjects of interest of the project roles.

To achieve this, the product owner creates a usage concept of the system as a "black box." This assists developers in crafting a system concept that describes the interactions of the system's functional parts and proposes its construction. It also ties into spatial layout and the evaluation of the total cost of ownership, taking into account the time for system operation and creation costs, thus describing the system as a "transparent box." These concepts are also used by visionaries to decide on the commercial feasibility of market entry with the target system.

Along with developers interested in the system as a "transparent box," architects, focusing on subjects of interest (known as "-ilities," such as availability, continuity, performance, recoverability, reliability, security, and scalability), define principles of dividing the system into modules and organizing the connections between them. The collection of such architectural decisions is called the system architecture, which, following the systems concept 3.0, results from a multitude of conflicts between system levels, choosing the least bad solutions rather than good ones, as system stability cannot be expected—instead, instability is prevalent. Hence, issues are bound to arise from higher or lower system levels.

The architect, guided by the **Principle of Continuity** (explained further in the subsection "Increment and Iteration"), endeavors to organize autonomous creation teams to release system increments for the most disconnected modules. The main team seeks accurate descriptions of all systems, sufficient for manufacturing the target system on the selected production platform—preferably creating an MVP rather than an ideal system. Manufacturing then implements the system using methods proposed by technologists and DevOps. Subsequently, system operation repeats prior actions to enhance some parts or transform subsystems, or even release other target systems.

For all this, an efficient creator system is needed (typically an organization or enterprise). For development and operation of the production platform (until profitability), the business owner draws resources from investors, with a vested interest in the enterprise's success.

Thinking about the creator system resembles a conveyor. Functional parts consist of project roles (organizational roles) executing various tasks using methods (including system descriptions, even for the creator system). Constructive parts consist of organizational units. Employees in different project roles perform tasks by designated methods, akin to being on a production line (with other agents, including other enterprises, AI, equipment). The operational manager leads this production activity, with initiation or orchestration undertaken by the development director, who might also play the role of CIO, launching development projects to reconstruct the current production platform as a part of continuous development efforts.

Systems thinking about changing the physical world occurs recursively across many levels and systems. In your projects or ventures, this might involve creating and developing not only a target system (with its subsystems) but also a creator system, often in an endless development process necessitating systems concepts and thinking mastery for organization.

The presented description of applying systems thinking may not be entirely clear, but the complete picture will develop as you progress through the main Aisystant program. You likely understood the initial part, but the latter, focusing on the creator system, may have been less clear. We will decode this part in this section.
