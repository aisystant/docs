title: Organizational Units, Services
---

Work is executed by **organizational units**. An organizational unit consists of agents (people, organizations, AI) along with the materials and equipment at their disposal. The smallest organizational unit is a single employee assigned to a specific position, managing the relevant resources.

Typically, organizational units do not initiate work on their own. In collaborative activities, some organizational units have the authority to delegate work to others, who are obligated to fulfill such requests. The entire set of organizational units with mutual authorities constitutes an **organization**. A target system can be created by an extended enterprise that may include multiple organizations, meaning the legal or organizational distinction is just one way to describe the system-creator.

Each organizational unit performs external behavior, which we refer to as a **service**. For example, within an enterprise, there's an organizational unit responsible for calculating salaries and another for disbursing them. These are the services of payroll processing and salary disbursement. Additionally, there are assembly services, such as automobile assembly. Organizational units can provide services to other organizational units or to the target system^[For instance, the automobile assembly service.].

Work emerges when an organizational unit receives a task and is provided with the necessary resources. Subsequently, the organizational unit delivers the required service, resulting in a **work product**. Without a task or resources, the service is not rendered, and the work is not completed.
