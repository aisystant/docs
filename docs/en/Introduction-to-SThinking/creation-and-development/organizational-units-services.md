title: Organizational Units and Services
---

The work is carried out by **organizational units**. An organizational unit consists of agents (people, organizations, AI) with materials and equipment at their disposal. The smallest organizational unit is a single employee, hired to a specific position and handling the corresponding resources.

Typically, organizational units do not initiate tasks on their own. In collective activities, some organizational units have the authority to assign work to others, who are obligated to fulfill these requests. The entire set of organizational units with mutual authorities constitutes an **organization**. A target system may be created by an extended enterprise, which can comprise several organizations. Thus, legal or organizational-legal separation is one of the possible descriptions of the system creator.

Each organizational unit performs external actions, which we refer to as **services**. For example, there is an organizational unit within a company that calculates salaries and another that disburses them. These are the salary calculation and disbursement services, respectively. There are also assembly services, such as automobile assembly. Organizational units can provide services to other organizational units or to the target system^[For example, automobile assembly service.].

Work emerges when an organizational unit is given an assignment and the necessary resources. The organizational unit then provides the required service, resulting in a **work product**. Without an assignment or resources, services are not rendered, and work is not performed.
