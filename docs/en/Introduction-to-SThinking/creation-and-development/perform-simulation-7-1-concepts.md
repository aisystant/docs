title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.1. Concepts'
---

List the five or more most memorable concepts from this section, and next to each, note the concepts they are most strongly connected to for you. These additional concepts can be from your current Worldviews, meaning you don't necessarily have to include only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or close friends. For example, try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, connect different concepts together, or explain their importance.

**Locate the corresponding assignment number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.**
