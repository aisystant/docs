Please review the examples. Write down the professional communities you are involved in (or have been involved in). If needed, make notes for further consideration. For instance, in the "Notes" column, you can jot down a future idea that comes to mind. By recording it immediately, you increase the chances of implementing it in the future.

**Locate the corresponding assignment by number in the workspace for modeling and complete all its parts.**
