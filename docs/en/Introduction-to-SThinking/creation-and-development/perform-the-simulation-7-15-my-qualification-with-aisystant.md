Text to translate:

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. In the "Life Mastery" column, evaluate your current life mastery using a 10-point scale. Life mastery is calculated as the average of the sum of thinking mastery and practical mastery. The thinking mastery score is determined as an average from the "Level of Thinking Mastery" table, while the practical mastery score is taken as an average from the "My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects" table.

Note your current Aisystant qualification and the year it was obtained. Also, note the years you obtained previous qualifications to assess progress. In the column "What needs to be done to obtain the next qualification," outline your self-development plans.

Please remember that unused knowledge fades away, so it's crucial to regularly validate your qualifications. It is not mandatory to do this within Aisystant, but we would be pleased if you share the results of your work and personal projects on Aisystant's public platforms. This will suffice for updating and obtaining a new qualification.

The highest qualification, “executor,” implies that you are capable of finding new challenges for yourself, creating successful systems that make the world a better place, and living a happy, successful, and fulfilling life.
