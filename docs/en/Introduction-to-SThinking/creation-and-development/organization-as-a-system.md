title: 'Translation: Organization as a System'
---

A system like an enterprise can be viewed as both a "black box" and a "transparent box."

When we refer to the "black box," an organization can be likened to a "person" — acting as an **agent** fulfilling a specific role. However, we can specify that the role of the designer is played by John Doe or the design bureau of OAO "Mostproject." The "black box" focuses attention on external or role-based behavior.

The "transparent box" emphasizes the internal structure of this "box." Inside an enterprise, people are organized alongside tools and resources, providing certain **services**. Instead of someone from outside requesting a function, the enterprise itself offers a service outwardly, making it optional for others to take it or leave it. This might be a design bureau offering design services, an assembly shop providing assembly services, or a hair salon offering haircuts. Thus, instead of "enterprise" (or organization), a more general term can be used – **organizational unit**.

An **organizational unit** is not just an enterprise but can also be a department, an individual employee with their tools, or even a temporary team (working group). The organization itself is comprised of organizational units, but this is only one perspective of the organization's structure.

We can approach the internal structure of an organization by considering the four main descriptions of the system as a "transparent box." We won't delve into the comparatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions here, but we will focus on the significant **differences between functional and modular decomposition for the organization system**.

Refer to the table presenting the main concepts and distinctions in the functional and modular examination of the organization.
