title: Organization as a System
---

The system of an enterprise, like any system, can be viewed as a "black box" and a "transparent box."

When we talk about a "black box," the organization can be compared to a "person"—acting as an **agent** that plays a specific role. However, we can certainly say that John Doe plays the role of the designer or that the project bureau of the Joint-Stock Company "Mostproekt" takes on this role. The "black box" focuses on external or role-based behavior.

The "transparent box" emphasizes the internal structure of this "box." Within an enterprise, there are people organized with tools and resources, and this enterprise provides certain **services** to others. This means that it's not someone from the outside requesting a function; rather, the enterprise itself offers a specific service, which can be accepted or declined. This could be a project bureau offering design services, an assembly shop providing assembly services, or a hair salon offering haircuts. Therefore, instead of using the term enterprise (or organization), we can use the more general term—"organizational unit."

An **organizational unit** is not just an enterprise; it can also be a department, an individual employee with their tools, or even a temporary team (a working group). The organization itself is also comprised of organizational units, but this is just one perspective on the structure of an organization.

When considering the internal structure of an organization, we can approach it through four main descriptions of the system as a "transparent box." Here, we will not delve into the relatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions but will focus on the important **distinction between functional and modular breakdown for the organization system.**

Please refer to the table below, which presents the main concepts and differences in the functional and modular perspective of the organization.
