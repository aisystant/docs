title: Preparation for Learning

Before starting your coursework project, set aside 30 minutes to organize your work schedule for the first week. After assessing your performance, you can make adjustments for the second and subsequent weeks.

This task is particularly important if you haven't engaged in long-term learning for a while. Treat the course as regular exercise for your brain, where your thinking processes are reprogrammed. Pay close attention to the assignments and consider jotting down your thoughts (hypotheses) for each task in a few words; this will help initiate thinking through writing. For example, you might respond to the second assignment like this: "I want to study the course in the morning for 30 minutes before work, then dedicate 1 hour during the day, and another 30 minutes in the evening. To achieve this, I'll start shifting my evening time to morning study: I'll go to bed 15 minutes earlier and start waking up earlier, beginning with 15 minutes of study each day and gradually increasing to 30 minutes."

1. Describe your expectations for the course. You can list work-related and personal challenges, along with aspects of yourself that you wish to improve. Writing this task down increases your chances of successfully completing the course and allows you to compare your expectations throughout the course and during your final preparations.

2. Modify your daily routine to include course study. Allocate 1-2 hours each day for the first week, marking this time in your personal calendar. Draft your hypothesis following the example above. Revisit it in a week and add any adjustments below this initial hypothesis.

3. Choose a time-tracking tool to monitor your course progress (ideally spending 2–4 Pomodoros per day, each lasting 25–30 minutes). For example, the smartphone app Focus To Do has a group called Aisystant that you can join with the code: JNSYL. Create a project named "My Learning" in the tracker. Start using the tracker initiation ritual: when you turn it on, think about assuming the role of a student, and that by the end of the Pomodoro session, you should have completed—reading a section (pages), creating educational notes, or producing work products for the project. Try not to study without the Pomodoro tracker and ritual compliance! Write how you understood this important student ritual, and if needed, refer to the post in the Aisystant club: https://systemsworld.club/t/zabyvaete-vklyuchat-treker-pomodoro-pochemu-eto-vazhno-i-kak-postavit-privychku/11580.

4. Register with Coda (e.g., via this link: <https://dash.partnerstack.com/invite/47d92fe146214dec904c286c31f77015>) or another similar program if you want to model in a professional environment.

5. Arrange your workspace so you aren't distracted while studying. Ideally, choose a well-ventilated room, a comfortable chair, and a screen that can be split into two parts: one for course study, the other for taking notes and modeling tables. Develop a routine: when you sit at your workspace, turn on the Pomodoro timer, and focus on performing as a student, creating various work products.

6. Understand that while studying, you aren't just taking notes; you're recording your thoughts, forming educational notes. If you’re unsure how to take notes (or don’t have a personal knowledge base), we recommend jotting down your thoughts in the "Questions for Review and Further Study" sections (located before the "Homework" section in each part). Choose the most relevant question that aligns with your thought, or write your thought under "My notes on the studied section." This way, you'll gradually answer all the questions while studying the section, rather than starting from scratch after reading it entirely.

Try to read the section within the first three days of the study week, dedicating the rest of the time to modeling and completing homework. Reserve the final day before the instructor-led training (or the 6th day of the week) as a backup. With proper planning, you can use this day to review the material, assist classmates, or comment on drafts in the Aisystant club (not just classmates') or formulate questions for the instructor.
