title: Target System and Collective Systems Thinking
---

**The Target System – Common for the Entire Team** or Members of an Extended Enterprise!

A target system is essential for managing collective operations and, primarily, collective attention. Through the concept of the "target system," every team member understands that they are part of a significant endeavor and that their individual work contributes to the entire team's efforts (systems creation). Yet, each person in a role or each company division may have its own system to create or develop, known as "our system."

The target system focuses the attention of a large creator-team on one shared endeavor. Recall the story of when President John F. Kennedy visited NASA's space center in 1962 and asked a janitor busy with his mop what he was doing. "Mr. President, I'm helping to send a man to the Moon." For the janitor, "our system" would be the clean floor, which he literally creates with his mop, bucket, and cloth.

Similarly, at a large Automotive corporation like BMW, there are numerous teams creating engines, assembly lines, factory cafeterias, etc. However, the target system for all of them is the "automobile." Yet, for each team, their "our system" would be the engine, the assembly line, or the cafeteria.

The choice of a target system is subjective and falls under the responsibility of the entrepreneur^[The term "entrepreneur" has many different meanings, so it’s always better to clarify.], whom we will call the **visionary.** Of course, many team members can participate in gathering information, analysis, and decision-making, but the final say regarding the target system belongs to the visionary. It is the agent in the role of the visionary who "stakes their skin in the game." Many other decisions depend on their choice.

For instance, Henry Ford, in the role of entrepreneur-visionary, decided that instead of using horse-drawn carriages, a self-propelled vehicle should be developed^[Note that the word for this system might not yet exist.]. Engineers then devised how this system should be structured. Systems are collectively created with numerous roles involved. The final structure of the target system (its design, function, internal setup, etc.) depends on considering all stakeholders, not just the visionary. However, there is no guarantee that the chosen target system is correct. It's an entrepreneurial task: propose a hypothesis and test it. Entrepreneurial risk has to be borne.

Systems thinking simplifies this process, though it does not eliminate the need to propose an **entrepreneurial hypothesis**. Nevertheless, it protects against obvious mistakes. For example, systems thinking requires verifying that the target system is indeed physical—that it is neither mere documentation nor something failing to change anything significant in the physical world. It also draws attention to the supersystem, the problems of the target audience, the needs of external project roles, and other working products across various areas of interest. Essentially, systems thinking offers a sort of checklist. While it doesn't guarantee the success of the target system, it helps avoid novice mistakes^[Such novice mistakes are more likely when dealing with something new, complicated, and unfamiliar.].

It should be noted that most employees work on projects where the target system has already been defined^[Often, projects are in full swing, yet few understand the target system. Nevertheless, it exists, though team members may not realize it.]. Someone in the visionary role previously selected the target system and initiated a project to create, alter, and enhance it. Those new to systems thinking should practice the skill of identifying the target system in existing businesses before, if needed, executing the visionary role^[And you will have to assume the visionary role, at least in personal projects.] and independently identifying the target system in their work and personal projects.
