title: Target System and Collective Systems Thinking
---

**The Target System – Common for the Entire Team or Members of the Extended Enterprise!**

The target system is essential for managing collective action and, primarily, collective focus. Thanks to the term "target system," every team member understands that they are part of a significant endeavor, and their specific contribution is part of the work of the entire team (systems creation collectives). However, each person in a role or a division of the enterprise may have their own system that they create or develop, called "our system."

The target system directs the focus of the large system-creator team toward one common endeavor. We can recall the story from 1962 when President John F. Kennedy asked a janitor at the NASA Space Center what he was doing as he held a mop. "I’m helping put a man on the Moon, Mr. President," he replied. Incidentally, for the janitor, "our system" was a clean floor, which he literally creates with a mop, bucket, and cloth.

Similarly, at a large corporation like BMW, there are many teams creating engines, assembly lines, cafeteria facilities, and so on. For all of them, the target system is the "automobile." However, "our system" for each team would be the engine, the assembly line, and the cafeteria.

The selection of the target system is subjective and falls under the responsibility of the entrepreneur, whom we refer to as the visionary. Of course, many team members can participate in gathering information, analysis, and decision-making, but the final word on the target system belongs to the visionary. The visionary puts their "skin in the game," and many other decisions depend on their choice.

For example, Henry Ford, as an entrepreneurial visionary, decided that instead of a horse-drawn carriage, a self-propelled vehicle was needed. The engineers then determined how this system should be organized. Systems are created collectively, involving numerous roles. The final structure of the target system (its design, function, internal arrangement, etc.) depends on considering all stakeholders, not just the visionary. However, there is no guarantee that the target system is chosen correctly. This is entrepreneurial work: one must propose and test a hypothesis, bearing entrepreneurial risk.

Systems thinking simplifies this process, although it doesn't eliminate the need to put forth an entrepreneurial hypothesis. Nevertheless, it helps avoid obvious mistakes. For example, systems thinking requires checking that the target system is indeed physical and not merely documentation or something that doesn't significantly change the physical world. It also draws attention to the supersystem, the problems of the target audience, the needs of external project roles, and other work products across various areas of interest. Essentially, systems thinking offers a checklist that, while not guaranteeing the success of the target system, helps avoid novice mistakes, especially when dealing with something new, complex, and unknown.

It should be noted that most employees work on projects where the target system is already defined. Even when a project is in full swing, few may understand the target system, but it exists; the team members merely don't realize it's there. Those beginning to study systems thinking need to practice identifying the target system in existing businesses and then, if necessary, assume the role of the visionary to independently determine the target system in their work and personal projects.
