title: Function and Service

**The Target System is conceived as a Deliverable Product (Physical Object).** This kind of system is typically manufactured by the project team from the raw materials procured by that team and then physically delivered to the consumer. The product then fulfills its requested function at the consumer's end, operating as part of a supersystem during usage.

For instance, imagine you are a watch manufacturer and watches are your target system. Customers use your target systems in two main ways:

- The first way is as part of their own target system. For example, a customer installs your watch-product in their car-product and later sells the car to their client, with the watch displaying time as the car is used.
- The second way is a client using the watch as part of the system for creating their car-product (the car being your client's product). For instance, the client may install your watch-product on the wall of their workshop so that workers can keep track of time during car assembly.

**An Alternative Option is to Trade Not in Product-Systems, but in Services.** You can hypothetically provide exact time upon request. For cars and workshops, a watch-product might be more preferable than a service providing time information on request. A well-known example of a service is a taxi. You can sell a car-product, or provide a transport service.

To provide a service, you need to create a system that generates that service. Here, you are not selling the system; the client pays you for the provided service. Considering the car example, the car is a product. You can sell it, allowing the customer to play both the driver and passenger roles—essentially driving themselves. Alternatively, you can offer the client a transport service, making them just a passenger. Your system organizing this transport service comprises, at minimum, a car and a driver, who is your employee.

Typically, a service is offered by a creating system, such as an enterprise. A good example is a hotel service, where a hotel provides accommodation and lodging services.

**A Service is a Behavior, Work, or a Benefit.** And it is delivered by a service enterprise or system: service equipment, server, department, provider. Feel the difference in those words?

Recall that we also referred to a system's behavior as a function. **By nature, function and service are not different. They both represent system behavior** (functional or role-based). Why, then, have two different terms?

The difference lies in the distinct slang specific to two types of consideration. The term "function" is used by external project roles wanting specific behavior in the supersystem. We say the system’s function is appointed from outside and needed in the supersystem. Meanwhile, the term "service" is used by internal project roles creating a system that ostensibly provides a service externally. But **will the provided service turn into the requested function**? The answer determines success.

Thus, the term **"service" represents the system's perspective** **towards** **its environment. The opposite perspective, from the environment/supersystem** **towards** **the system, is the term** **function**. It is quite possible for different names to exist for the same function. A nail-driving service might be a wood-fastening function. A water-suction service could become an antifreeze-pumping function.

Function refers to system behavior from the supersystem's perspective, needed by clients for something specific. Service, from its developer's viewpoint, refers to a system's behavior. Developers might say, "I don’t know what it’s needed for, but I can change the world (environment) with a specific service." Alternatively, "function" helps view system behavior within the supersystem^[Or subsystem within the system.] as either a functional or role-based object, while "service" considers it as a constructive object. Service often describes the behavior of a creating system impacting the target system.

Don’t be surprised if for the same subject, product, and behavior, you encounter vastly differing dialogues: it reflects different interests.

Sometimes clients might say that the provided service doesn’t meet their expectations. This means they expect a specific function, but the service quality doesn’t align with those expectations. For instance, spending a night in a hotel to sleep, wash, etc., is one perspective, driven by needs and functions. Another comes from the manager and other roles designing and managing the hotel. Here, the management team examines the services offered to guests. If the subsystems and the hotel are poorly designed^[For example, by not studying the hotel’s target audience needs adequately.], complaints about service quality arise. Clients can’t critique their requests (i.e., do not use functional slang); instead, they complain in the management company’s language, claiming that the service^[As we know, the creation team employs the term "service."] is subpar.

Understand that producers and service-oriented **companies aim to label their product systems and services so that potential buyers quickly** **recognize** **their functional requests.** The market, however, determines how successful this is.

In this context, companies must properly position their services to prevent unintended use by non-target audiences. For example, if Aisystant offers its current educational services to schoolchildren or those seeking easy learning, we will undoubtedly receive feedback on inadequate teaching quality.
