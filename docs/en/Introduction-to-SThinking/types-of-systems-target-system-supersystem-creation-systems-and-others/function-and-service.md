**A Target System Conceived as a Delivered Product (Physical Object)**

A target system is often conceived as a delivered product—a physical object. Such a system is typically crafted by the project team using materials they procure, and then physically delivered to the consumer. At the consumer's end, this product fulfills the requested function, operating within a larger system during usage.

For instance, if you are a watch manufacturer, your watches are target systems. Your clients utilize these target systems in two ways:

* The first way is as part of their target system. For example, a client installs your product watches into their product cars. The car, once sold to their client, then uses the watch to display time during its operation.
* The second way is within the system for creating their product—cars. For instance, a client mounts your product watch on the wall of their workshop, allowing workers to track time during car assembly.

**Alternative Option — Providing Services Instead of Product Systems**

Hypothetically, you could dispatch accurate time upon request. However, for cars and workshops, a product watch might be more desirable than a service providing the time upon request. But there is a well-known example of a service—taxis. One can sell a car-product, or offer a transportation service.

To offer a service, you need to create a system that produces the said service. You don't sell the system; instead, the client pays for the provided service. Taking the car example, it's viewed as a product. You could sell the car for the client to act as both driver and passenger. Alternatively, you could offer a transportation service, where the client is only a passenger. Your system organizing the transportation service involves at least a car and a driver employed by your business.

Typically, a system creation, such as an enterprise, offers the service. A good example is a hotel service, where a hotel provides lodging and overnight services.

**Service is Behavior, a Function, a Service**

A service is provided by a service enterprise or system: service equipment, a server, a department, or a provider. Feel the difference in words?

Recall that we referred to the system's behavior as a function. **By nature, a function and a service don't differ. They're both system behavior** (whether functional or role-based). So why have two separate terms?

It's because different jargon is used for different kinds of examination. The term "function" is used by external project roles that desire certain behavior in the supersystem. We say a function is assigned from outside, needed in the supersystem. "Service" is used by internal project roles that create the system to offer a service outwardly. But will the issued service become the requested function? That will determine success.

So, the term **"service" is the system's perspective toward its environment**. The reverse perspective, from the environment/supersystem to the system, is a function. The name of the function can indeed differ. A service of driving nails may serve as the function of board fastening. A service of water suction might function as coolant infusion.

A function is behavior sought from the supersystem when clients need a specific function. A service is behavior from the developer's perspective, thinking "I'm unsure why it's needed, but I can alter the environment (or world) with a certain service." Or, functions can describe system behavior in supersystems^[or subsystems within systems.] as functional or role-based objects. Services describe behavior concerning development as a constructive object. Normally, services denote behavior from the creation system affecting the target system.

So, don't be surprised if you hear two entirely different conversations about the same item, product, and its behavior: the different interests at play here dictate this.

Clients might express dissatisfaction with a provided service, meaning their expectations of a specific function aren’t met by the service quality. For example, spending a night at a hotel involves sleeping, washing, etc.—terms of needs and functions. From a manager's and other roles' view, designing and managing the hotel, they examine guest services. If not carefully designed^[like poorly understanding the target audience needs.], service quality complaints arise. Clients won't critique their requests (i.e., using function jargon) but use management’s language—declaring the **service** poor.

Understanding that product manufacturers and service-oriented **companies desire naming their system-products and services such that potential buyers readily** **identify their functional needs.** How well this succeeds is determined by the market.

Thus, companies must accurately position their services so they're not accidentally utilized by non-target audiences. For example, if Aisystant offers its current educational services to schoolchildren or light-learning enthusiasts, we'd undoubtedly receive feedback about flawed education.
