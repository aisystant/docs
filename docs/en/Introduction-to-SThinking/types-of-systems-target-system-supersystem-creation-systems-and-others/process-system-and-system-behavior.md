title: Process, System, and System Behavior

**Creating Systems** should not be confused with the **process of creating** a targeted system. More precisely, do not confuse a system with a process. We say that different systems, which we refer to as creating systems, participate in the creation process^[In this context, "participation" in an activity (changes, processes, procedures) is simply a specialization of the "composition relation."]. Together, they form a creator system.

Accordingly, when we use the term "process"^[Outside of Aisystant, the word "process" might be used as a synonym for "practice." However, we distinguish "process" from "practice" as they are different types.], we mean the interaction of different systems resulting in **the emergence of a working product**. If creating systems are involved in this process, the outcome is a working product—the target system. Similarly, if it’s a thinking through writing process involving a thinker and a computer (exocortex), the result is a draft post on the computer.

Sometimes, it's easy to identify a supersystem for all the systems involved in a process. For example, consider the combustion process, involving a piston, a cylinder, a crankshaft mechanism, a crankshaft, a cooling subsystem, etc. All these systems form an internal combustion engine (ICE). However, sometimes there isn't enough perspective or a widely recognized cultural term for such a supersystem (like ICE). Nonetheless, **you must not confuse the names** **of a process** **with those of a system**, as in the example above.

The systems involved in the process change their state or exhibit specific behavior. **By behavior,** we mean the interaction of a system with its environment, termed "external behavior" or "role behavior." For instance, each system involved in the combustion process^[A piston behaves differently from a cylinder.] has distinct types of behavior. Similarly, inside a clock, there's a process of counting seconds involving gears, springs, and other clock subsystems. But the entire engine's behavior^[Delivering torque.] also plays a part in another process—transporting goods and passengers. The working product of this process is goods and passengers moved through space.

In conclusion, do not confuse concept types—process, system, and role behavior.
