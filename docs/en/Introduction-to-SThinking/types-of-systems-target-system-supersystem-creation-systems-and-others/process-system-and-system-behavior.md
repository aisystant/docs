### Systems of Creation

**Systems of creation** should not be confused with the **process of creating** a target system. More precisely, it's important not to mix up a system with a process. We state that in the process of creation, various systems are involved^[The "participation relationship" in an activity (changes, processes, procedures) is simply a specialization of the "composition relationship."]. These systems are what we refer to collectively as systems of creation, and together, they form a creator system.

Accordingly, when we use the term "process"^[Outside of Aisystant, the word "process" might be used synonymously with the term "practice." However, we differentiate between "process" and "practice" as distinct types.], we mean the interaction of different systems that results in **the emergence of some working product**. If systems of creation are involved in this process, the result is a working product—the target system. Similarly, in the process of thinking through writing, which involves the thinker and a computer (exocortex), the result is a working product—a draft post on the computer.

Sometimes it's easy to identify a supersystem for all the systems involved in a process. For example, consider the combustion process of a fuel mixture, involving the piston, cylinder, crankshaft, connecting rod mechanism, cooling subsystem, etc. Together, these systems form an internal combustion engine (ICE). However, there are times when our perspective is limited, or the culture lacks a widespread name for such a supersystem (like ICE). Nonetheless, **you must not confuse the names** of the **process** and the **system**, as demonstrated in the example above.

The systems involved in the process change their states or exhibit specific behaviors. **Behavior** describes the interaction of the system with its environment, referred to as "external behavior" or "role behavior." For example, each of the systems mentioned above^[The piston behaves in one way, the cylinder in another.], involved in the combustion process of the fuel mixture^[Similarly, inside a clock, there is an ongoing process of measuring seconds, involving gears, springs, and other clock subsystems.] has distinct behavior. Even the engine itself exhibits behavior^[Delivering torque.], participating, alongside the chassis and cabin, in another process—the transportation of goods and passengers. The working product of the latter process is the movement of goods and passengers through space.

In summary, do not confuse the types of concepts—process, system, or role behavior.
