Translation:

Various **systems in the environment** interact in different ways with the target system. For example, in relation to a car, the systems in the environment would include the driver and passengers, as well as the road, pedestrian, and so on. There are systems in the immediate environment and those in the distant environment. Systems in the immediate environment, together with the target system, form a supersystem. In our example, the trip includes not only the car but also the driver and passenger. Systems in the distant environment are those that interact with the target system during its operation stage. For instance, the road and pedestrian.

**Subsystems**^[All three main systems have subsystems, but if it is not specified which system is being referred to, it is always assumed to be the target system.] are parts of the target system. For a car, subsystems include the engine, cabin, chassis, and so on. Subsystems are physically part of the target system, while the target system, in turn, is a subsystem of the supersystem.

Ultimately, the chain of subsystem-target system-supersystem represents **systems levels**. Look at the diagram with arrows: an arrow from "Subsystems" "enters" the "Target System," and the "Target System" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of the car, and the car is part of the household.

The creating system, which consists of creation systems, does not fall within the systems levels. Its relationship with the target system is differentâ€”one of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the target system and the supersystem is one of embedding or a "part-whole" relationship.
