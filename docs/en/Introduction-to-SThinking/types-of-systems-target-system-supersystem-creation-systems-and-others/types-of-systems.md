title: Types of Systems

When working with a **system's environment**, various systems interact with the target system in different ways. For example, in the context of a car, the systems in the environment include the driver, passenger, road, pedestrian, etc. There are systems in the immediate environment and those in the distant environment. Systems in the immediate environment, together with the target system, form a supersystem. In our example, the trip includes not only the car but also the driver and passenger. Systems in the distant environment interact with the target system during its operation phase. For instance, these are the road and the pedestrian.

**Subsystems**^[Subsystems are part of all three main systems, but if not specified, they are assumed to refer to the target system.] are parts of the target system. For a car, subsystems include the engine, cabin, chassis, and so on. Subsystems are physically part of the target system, and in turn, the target system acts as a subsystem for the supersystem.

Ultimately, the chain of subsystem-target system-supersystem symbolizes **systems levels**. Take a look at the diagram with arrows: from "Subsystems," an arrow "enters" the "Target System," and the "Target System" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of the car, and the car is part of the household.

A creator system, composed of creation systems, does not fit within the system levels. Its relationship with the target system is one of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the target system and the supersystem is one of inclusion or a "part-whole" relationship.
