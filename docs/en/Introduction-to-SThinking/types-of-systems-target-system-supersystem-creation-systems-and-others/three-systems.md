title: Three Systems
---

In this section, you will learn about types of systems that need to be identified and worked with in any project. Its goal is to introduce you, through simple examples, to the target system, supersystems, and creator systems, as well as to teach you to distinguish between product and service, function and service.

In the modern systems approach, the following three main systems are highlighted to help manage attention in complex project activities. These are the **target system, supersystem, and the creator**.

In the world, everything is interconnected, so we identify systems by focusing on them, much like isolating parts of an elephant. When we highlight the subsystem 'tail', we don't literally separate it from the body. Separate parts and the system itself **are identified from the overall context** using **attention** as well. In different projects and even within the same project, the same physical object can be a different system or part of various systems.

At Aisystant courses, participants are taught techniques for this identification and trained in the fluency of working with each system and all of them collectively. In this section, we'll discuss each of the three main systems.

The **target system** is the primary system for which the project activity (or the process of creation and development) is conducted. We consider activity^[In this activity, systems creation participate. You should already distinguish the type "activity" from the type "system."] and its result—the target system—separately. When we talk about a change-agent influencing the world, it implies that they are introducing a target system into the physical world. The target system is created to solve problems for a certain group of people—consumers, clients. For example, for the "BMW" Automotive corporation, the target system might be the "i8" car.

The **supersystem** is a system into which the target system physically enters. The target system is part of the supersystem, showcasing the classic property of nesting. The target system "car" can be part of supersystems like "household" or "fleet." The supersystem needs to be chosen based on the specific project. Simply naming a supersystem, based on an ideal system like "car," will be impossible. The supersystem^[There can be several supersystems. This depends on the team wanting to consider different stakeholders. Each supersystem "brings" its own external project roles.] needs to not only be identified but also studied in detail, so we will further consider such a working product as a usage concept.

The main methodological technique is to trace the **physical nesting of the target system into the supersystem**. Students often stumble here. It's easy to see system nesting when talking about "iron systems." For example, an engine is part of a car. However, as we know, systems can be more complex^[For example, a water safety system.], and thus it is necessary to train the ability to see the nesting relationship and corresponding systems levels^[The target system and supersystem are two systems levels. Systems creation are not part of this systems division.].

The third type of systems is the **creator system** or the collective **systems creation.** These are systems involved in conceptualizing, designing, producing, repairing, and disposing of the target system. For example, a creator system might be an organization, while systems creation might be its subdivisions. We can also speak of an extended enterprise as a creator system, which includes numerous organizations.

For instance, an extended enterprise might create the target system car, or the creation of a car might involve various systems creation. They participate in the car creation process. So, the BMW factory, dealers that sell and repair the car, and recyclers—all of these are systems creation for the target system "i8 car." Together, they form an extended enterprise or a creator system.
