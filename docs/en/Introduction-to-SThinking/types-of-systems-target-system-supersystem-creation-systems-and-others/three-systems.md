## Types of Systems You'll Encounter in Projects

In this section, you'll learn about the types of systems that you need to identify and work with in any project. The goal is to familiarize you with the target system, supersystem, and creation systems using simple examples, as well as to teach you to distinguish between product and service, and function and service.

In the modern systems approach, three main systems are emphasized that help manage attention in complex project activities. These are the **target system, supersystem, and creator**.

In the world, everything is connected to everything else, so we distinguish systems through attention, just as we would highlight parts of an elephant. By identifying the subsystem tail, we are not literally separating it from the body. Individual parts and the system itself are also distinguished **from the general context** through **attention**. For different projects, and even within a single project, the same physical object can be seen as a different system or part of different systems.

Aisystant courses teach the techniques for this kind of distinction and train individuals to work fluently with each system and with all of them together. In this section, we will initially discuss each of the three main systems.

**Target System** – This is the main system for which project activities (or the process of creation and development) occur. We consider the activity separately^[In this activity, creation systems are involved. You should already distinguish the type "activity" from the type "system."] and its result separately – the target system. When we talk about an agent changing the world, we imply that they introduce a target system into the physical world. The target system is created to solve the problems of a specific group of people—consumers, clients. For instance, for the automotive corporation "BMW," the target system might be the "i8" car.

**Supersystem** – This is the system into which the target system physically fits. The target system is part of the supersystem, reflecting the classic characteristic of hierarchical embedding. The target system "car" may be part of supersystems such as "household" or "fleet." Choosing the right supersystem depends on the specific project and cannot be randomly assigned based on an ideal system like a "car." The supersystem^[There might be multiple supersystems. It depends on the team considering various stakeholders. Each supersystem brings its own external project roles.] not only needs to be defined but also studied in detail. Therefore, we will further explore a working product such as the concept of usage.

The main methodological approach is to trace the **physical embedding of the target system within the supersystem**. Students usually struggle here. It's easy to see the embedding when discussing "hardware systems." For instance, a motor is part of a car. However, as we know, systems can be more complex^[For example, water safety systems.], so it's necessary to train the ability to see the nesting relationship and corresponding system levels^[The target system and the supersystem represent two system levels. Creation systems do not belong to this system division.].

The third type of systems is the **creator system**, or a collection of **creation systems**. These are the systems involved in the conception, design, production, repair, and disposal of the target system. For example, a creator system can be an organization, while creation systems are its subdivisions. We can also discuss an extended enterprise as a creator system, consisting of multiple organizations.

For instance, an extended enterprise creates the target system car, or different creation systems are involved in the car's creation. They participate in the process of creating the car. That is, BMW factories, dealers who sell and repair the car, and recyclers—all are creation systems for the target system "i8 car." Together, they form an extended enterprise or creator system.
