In the diagram below, you see the same types of systems that were discussed earlier, but from a slightly different perspective. This diagram from the textbook "Systems Thinking" illustrates that **different systems are distinguished in relation to a target system**. If we talk about a supersystem, it means there is a target system, and if there is a system of creation, it always corresponds to a target system.

However, before identifying a target system, it is necessary to understand your roles, team, and organization. This understanding allows you to define your responsibilities and authorities, which determine the systemic level and the boundaries of both the target and our systems. You might be authorized to create a piston, an entire engine, or the overall automobile. **Once you determine the target system, you can then structure all other systems**. This includes defining "our system." However, sometimes it's the other way around: you have a good understanding of "our system" and only then start looking for the target system.

What is the first thing to do with the supersystem? It is crucial to ensure that the target system is an integral physical part of this system at the time of operation, meaning it is literally part of the supersystem. For instance, a pump is part of a pumping station. Unfortunately, most mistakes arise from disregarding this characteristic of the supersystem.

**The same target system can have multiple supersystems**, depending on the context in which the target system is used. For example, for an automobile, the supersystem can be "driver+automobile+passenger"^[It's hard to name such a system, perhaps "equipped crew"? Here, different project roles, surrounding systems (asphalt road or dirt road, pedestrians or wild animals, etc.) emerge.]. On the other hand, you can consider the automobile in the context of the garage where it is parked. Then, the garage with the automobile is also a separate supersystem for the target system automobile. There can be multiple supersystems. Each such consideration determines project roles, surrounding systems, needs, etc.

**Systems subdivision or systems levels** refer to the nesting of systems within each other: a subsystem fits into the target system, which in turn fits into the supersystem. However, the system of creation is not included in this systems subdivision, so in the picture, it is highlighted separately.

From the depicted diagram, another important principle can be gleaned. This is a kind of **recursion**. The supersystem of our project can be considered a target system for our clients, while our target system can be a supersystem for someone else.

The naming of types of systems depends on the team working at a certain system level. They have authorities and responsibilities for the systems at the corresponding level. For one team, the target system might be the automobile, and the battery would be a subsystem. However, your team might very well designate the battery as the target system, particularly because it could be used in different supersystems: automobiles, homes, etc.

There is no definite template or strict rule on how to name systems. Each team independently determines how to label what they work with—whether it’s "our system" or the "target system." This is also the task of the visionary. Systems thinking only requires adhering to the principle of physical nesting, but also separately considering surrounding systems and systems of creation, along with other thinking methodologies.
