title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

First, we got acquainted with the following types of systems: target system, supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, systems within the environment, and "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects to gain fluency in segmenting the world into different systems.

Second, we discussed the difference between activity and system, product and service, service and function. You might feel that many of these concepts are unnecessary, but trust meâ€”they were created to describe more accurately the various interests involved in the creation of a successful system.

One of the main techniques in using systems approach is the ability to distinguish and see connections between the primary types of systems.

**Main Concepts:** target system, supersystem, environmental systems, creator system, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
