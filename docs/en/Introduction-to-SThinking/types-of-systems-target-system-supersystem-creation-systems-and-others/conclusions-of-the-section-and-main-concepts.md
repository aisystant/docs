title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts
---

First, we were introduced to the following types of systems: target system, supersystem, creation systems, subsystems, environmental systems, and "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to learning examples and then to your work projects to gain fluency in dividing the world into different systems.

Second, we discussed the difference between activity and system, product and service, service and function. It might seem to you that many concepts are excessive, but trust meâ€”they are designed to more accurately describe the various interests involved when creating a successful system.

One of the main techniques using systems approach is the ability to distinguish and see the connections between the primary types of systems.

**Main Concepts:** target system, supersystem, environmental systems, system-as-creator, creation systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
