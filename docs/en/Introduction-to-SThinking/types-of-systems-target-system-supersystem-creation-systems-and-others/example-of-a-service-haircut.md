title: Example of a Service - "Haircut"
---

Let's consider an example with a hair salon. A hair salon belongs to the service sector. It doesn't produce system-products in the way an automotive factory does. If you ask anyone what a hair salon does, they will answer that a hair salon cuts hair.

Thus, **a hair salon provides a service—haircuts.** It offers a standardized set of actions, like a crew cut or a styled cut, "as if outwardly." When we talk about a hair salon, it's appropriate to use terms like "service."

However, a hair salon is a system-enterprise, which means it has a target system that the salon creates as a system of creation. This **target system is the hairstyle**. The supersystem for the hairstyle could be a well-groomed head or a lady ready for a theater outing. In turn, we can identify surrounding systems—makeup, earrings, dress.

Not the entire hair salon is involved in the haircutting service, so it's more accurate to name the parts of the enterprise directly engaged in this procedure. This includes the hairdresser with all their tools (technologies) such as scissors^[In turn, scissors also provide a service—cutting.], clippers, combs, etc. There is an **internal process involving the hairdresser with scissors, and an external service that is delivered as a result of this internal process**. A systems practitioner can discuss them separately; hence there are different concepts—process, service, systems.

In turn, scissors are designed for a specific functional purpose. Creators of scissors must understand the intended or client-requested function^[Scissors creators follow the principle: "the finger presses the table, but the table does not press the finger," meaning scissors are an active object that cuts hair, thus providing a service. Hair is considered a passive object. The effect of hair on scissors is neglected when evaluating the functional (role) behavior of scissors. However, the reverse consideration is also possible. It all depends on focus—it's impossible to simultaneously consider all interactions and influences. Read more about why Aristotelian rather than Newtonian physics is used in systems thinking in the "Aristotelian Physics in Systems Thinking" section of the "Systems Thinking" textbook.]. It's one thing if it's a hairdresser, and another thing for a gardener. Although the principle of scissors work is the same, hairdressing scissors are created for the former and pruners for the latter.

If this example isn't sufficiently clear to you, be sure to think about it using thinking through writing. Also, note any questions you might want to ask in the "Systems Thinking" course support chat. For those who understand this example, try to come up with a similar one.
