title: The Essence of Systems Thinking
---

Knowing all types of systems allows you to navigate complex activities more quickly than others. You can effectively dissect the world with your attention, identifying specific systems. The world is complex, and all its elements are interconnected. It is difficult for the human brain to grasp all these connections, which is why **in systems thinking, principles are established to logically divide the world into parts.** Handling individual parts makes understanding much easier without losing the connection of each part to the whole.

For instance, in the diagram from the "Systems Thinking" course^[You'll understand this diagram better when you start describing your activities by identifying the relevant systems.], you can see the system levels in relation to the target system, marked by a red circle. At the top level, there's a supersystem (the large circle containing the red circle), within which the target system (red circle) exists, along with two systems in its environment at the same system level. Within the target system, we observe three subsystems at its system level. Our example of a car fits well with this scheme. Try to associate the car with its subsystems, the driver, and the passenger.

Behind the dotted line are numerous systems of creation. Some form the supersystem, others are involved in creating the target system, and yet others take part in creating subsystems. Using this diagram, one can discuss not only the car and the factory but also the system that builds the factory. While such complicated diagrams aren't always necessary, it is crucial to understand that systems thinking aids in considering the most complex systems and activities. Attempt to examine your enterprise's activities using this diagram. I'll say upfront, it will be quite challenging. We delve deeper into student cases during training sessions with an instructor.
