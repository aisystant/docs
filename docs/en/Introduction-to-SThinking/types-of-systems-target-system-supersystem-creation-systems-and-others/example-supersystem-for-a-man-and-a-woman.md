title: 'Example: Supersystem for Man and Woman'
---

Let's consider a simple example involving agents represented by a man and a woman. What supersystems might exist with them participating in specific roles? Yes, they interact in some way and possess functionality within the supersystem. What is that functionality?

I hope you quickly realized that the supersystem here could be a family, where the woman and man are part of each other's systems environment, playing the roles of wife and husband. In other words, it's not just a woman and a man in the family, but a wife and a husband.

Solving the riddle of naming the supersystem involves identifying a missing, unnamed, or undefined system within the system breakdown. This is a typical situation: **supersystems are usually hard to distinguish, and sometimes they lack established names**^[Often, certain systems do not have established names in culture, unlike the concept of "family." In your work projects, you will frequently have to introduce new names for systems. Remember that it's crucial to name a system based on its primary function.].

These "missing" systems need to be identified by describing their roles or functions and finding an appropriate name based on the role. Sometimes, finding the most accurate words will be necessary. For instance, for a car with a driver and a passenger, a supersystem needs to be identified, but there isn't a suitable option yet. As soon as you find an appropriate name for the system, much becomes clearer and simpler. Learn to name systems correctly and work with semantics^[Semantics is one of the 16 transdisciplinary fields of the intelligence stack.].
