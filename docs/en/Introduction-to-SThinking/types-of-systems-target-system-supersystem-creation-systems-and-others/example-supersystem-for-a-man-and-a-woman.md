title: 'Example: Supersystem for a Man and a Woman'
---

Let's consider an everyday example involving agents in the form of a man and a woman. What suprasystems might exist with their participation in specific roles? Yes, they interact in some way, and they each have a functionality within the suprasystem. But what is it?

I hope you quickly realized that the suprasystem here can be a family, with the woman and man interacting in each other's environmental system, performing the roles of wife and husband. In other words, the family consists not of a woman and a man, but of a wife and a husband.

We can solve the puzzle of naming the suprasystem by identifying a missing, unnamed, or unrecognized system within the system breakdown. This is a typical situation: **suprasystems are usually hard to distinguish, and sometimes they lack established names**^[Often in culture, there are no established names for certain systems, unlike the concept of "family". In your work projects, you'll frequently have to introduce new system names. Remember that the name should reflect the main function of the system.].

These "missing" systems need to be identified, meaning their roles or functions must be described and somehow named according to their role. Sometimes you'll need to choose the most precise words. For example, finding a suprasystem for a car with a driver and passenger has been challenging, but as soon as you find a suitable name for the system, everything becomes clearer and simpler. Learn to name systems accurately and engage with semantics^[Semantics is one of the 16 transdisciplines of the intelligence stack.].
