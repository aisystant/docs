title: Supersystem, System Levels, and Recursion
---

Below, you see the same types of systems previously discussed, but from a slightly different perspective. The diagram from the Systems Thinking textbook shows that **different systems are distinguished in relation to a target system**. If we're talking about a supersystem, it means there is a target system, and if there's a creation system, it always corresponds to a target system.

However, before identifying a target system, it's essential to consider your roles, team, and enterprise. This understanding helps define your responsibility and authorities, which determine the system level and the boundaries of both the target system and our system. You might be given the authority to create a piston, the entire engine, or the car as a whole. **Once you choose the target system, you can then structure all the other systems**, including establishing "our system." Sometimes, it's the other way around: you have a good grasp of "our system" and only then begin to identify the target system.

What is the first thing to do with the supersystem? It's necessary to ensure that the target system, during its operation, is an integral, physical part of this supersystem—in other words, it literally fits into the composition of the supersystem. For instance, a pump is part of a pumping station. Regrettably, most mistakes happen due to a lack of attention to this characteristic of the supersystem.

**The same target system can have multiple supersystems**. It all depends on the context of the target system's use. For example, in the context of a car, the supersystem could be "driver+car+passenger"^[It’s challenging to find a name for such a system; perhaps "equipped crew"? This gives rise to various project roles and surrounding systems (asphalt roads, dirt roads, pedestrians, wild animals, etc.).]. On the other hand, a garage where the car is parked can be considered a supersystem for the car as the target system. There can be several such supersystems. From each of these perspectives, project roles, surrounding systems, needs, etc., are defined.

**System partitioning or systems levels** refer to the nesting of systems within one another: a subsystem is part of a target system, which in turn is part of a supersystem. However, the creation system is not included in this partitioning; thus, it is separately highlighted in the diagram.

Another important principle can be drawn from this diagram. It's a kind of **recursion**. The supersystem of our project might be called the target system for our clients, and our target system might serve as a supersystem for someone else.

The names of the types of systems depend on the team working at a certain system level. This team has the responsibilities and authorities for the systems at that level. For one team, the car will be the target system, and the battery will be a subsystem. However, your team might very well consider the battery as the target system, particularly because it will be used in different supersystems: cars, homes, etc.

There is no unambiguous template or strict rule for naming systems. Each team determines how to name what it works with—whether "our system" or "target system." This is also the role of a visionary. Systems thinking requires adherence to the principle of physical nesting while considering surrounding systems and creation systems separately, along with other thinking techniques.
