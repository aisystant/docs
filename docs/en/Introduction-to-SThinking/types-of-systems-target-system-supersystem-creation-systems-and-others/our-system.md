title: Our System

**The concept of "our system"** allows an individual or a team to identify their system or their place within a larger collective activity. This could involve activities specific to your company or activities spanning multiple companies. In the latter case, we can refer to it as an **"extended enterprise."** For instance, diverse companies participate in sending a person to space.

Note that **our system can be a subsystem of the target system or one of the systems in creation**. Thus, the operation of a large company can be divided into various projects, each responsible for creating different "our systems." However, every "our system" maintains a certain connection to the target system.

A systems team and a systems specialist must comprehend how they contribute to the overall activity of creating the target system. An important technique in systems thinking is the ability to identify your system among many others, as well as understand its connection to other systems and the teams that create these systems.

In an extended enterprise, numerous teams work, with each focusing on their own system ("our system" being unique to each). For example, one team may be developing a car engine, meaning their "our system" is the engine. In this case, they will still consider the car as their target system, establishing their connection to the larger collective producing the car. The engine, for this team, represents "our system." Here, "our system" forms part of the target system. Yet for another team within an automotive corporation, "our system" might be the assembly line, which relative to the car, is a part of the system of creation.

Let us emphasize once again that **"our system" and the target system help employees at the enterprise see their specific area of work and understand how their efforts relate to the main outcome for the entire company**.
