title: Our System

The concept of "our system" allows an individual or a team to find their system or their place within a large collective operation. This could involve activities at your company or across multiple companies. In the latter case, we can speak of an **extended enterprise**. For example, various companies are involved in sending a person to space.

Note that **our system can be a subsystem of the target system or one of the creation systems**. Thus, the activities of a large company can be divided into numerous projects, each responsible for creating different "our systems." Every "our system" is connected in some way to the target system.

A systems team and a systems specialist must understand how they contribute to the large-scale activities involved in creating the target system. An important systems thinking technique is the ability to identify their system among many others and to comprehend its relationship with other systems and teams that are creating these systems.

In an extended enterprise, a large number of teams are working, each dealing with its own system ("our system" is unique to each). For example, one team is creating a car engine, meaning "our system" for this team is the engine. Nevertheless, they consider the car to be their target system. This ensures the team's connection with the larger group that manufactures the car. For this team, the engine is "our system." In this case, "our system" is a part of the target system. However, for some team within an automotive corporation, "our system" might be the assembly line, and in relation to the car, the assembly line is part of the creation system.

Let us emphasize once more that **our system and the target system help people at a company clearly see their specific area of work and understand how their efforts relate to the key outcome for the entire enterprise**.
