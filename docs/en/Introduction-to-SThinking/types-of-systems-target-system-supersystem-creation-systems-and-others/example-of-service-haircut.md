title: Example of Service - "Haircut"
---

Let's consider an example with a hair salon. A hair salon is part of the service industry. It doesn't produce systems-products in the way an automotive plant does. If you ask anyone what a hair salon does, they'll likely say that a hair salon cuts hair.

Therefore, **a hair salon provides the service of haircuts.** It offers a standardized set of actions "outwardly," such as a Canadian cut, a fashionable cut, etc. When discussing a hair salon, it is appropriate to use terms like "service" and "care."

However, a hair salon is a system-enterprise, which means it has a target system that the hair salon creates as a system of creation. This **target system is a hairstyle**. The supersystem for a hairstyle would be a well-groomed head or a lady ready for the theater. In turn, you can identify surrounding systems like makeup, earrings, and a dress.

Not all of the hair salon takes part in the haircut service, so it is more accurate to refer to parts of the enterprise directly involved in this procedure. This includes the hairdresser with all their tools (technologies) like scissors^[In turn, scissors also provide a service – cutting.], clippers, combs, and so on. Thus, **there is an internal process involving the hairdresser with scissors, and there is an external service delivered as a result of this internal process**. A systems thinker can discuss them separately, leading to different concepts—process, service, systems.

In turn, scissors are specially designed for a certain functional purpose. Scissors designers must understand the intended or client-requested function^[Scissors designers are guided by the principle: "the finger presses on the table, but the table does not press on the finger," meaning scissors are an active object that cuts hair, thus providing a service. Hair is considered a passive object. The action of hair on scissors is disregarded when considering the functional (role-based) behavior of scissors. However, the opposite consideration is also possible. It's all about focus. It is not possible to simultaneously consider all interactions and influences. For more details on why systems thinking uses the principles of Aristotelian rather than Newtonian physics, see the section "Aristotelian Physics in Systems Thinking" in the textbook "Systems Thinking."]. It’s one thing if it's for a hairdresser, and another if it's for a gardener. Although the principle of scissors' operation is the same, special hairdressing scissors are made for the former, and pruners (garden scissors) for the latter.

If you find this example not entirely clear, you should reflect on it using thinking through writing. Also, note questions you might want to ask in the support chat for the "Systems Thinking" course. If you understand this example, try to provide a similar one.
