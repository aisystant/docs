Course "Introduction to Systems Thinking"

The "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course will help you take your first step into the fascinating world of systems thinking. In this course, you will become familiar with the **main concepts** of systems thinking and start applying them to both work and personal projects.

You can follow the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course **independently or as part of group instruction with an instructor**. If you enroll with an instructor, you will receive feedback on all your questions and homework. The instructor will highlight numerous pitfalls, help you navigate complex aspects, and accelerate your understanding of the complex world of systems thinking.

The course comprises 7 sections^[We strongly recommend arming yourself with a pen or taking notes on your computer while reading. It's proven that consuming information while simultaneously recording arising ideas and questions significantly enhances learning.] and 7 homework assignments (hereinafter referred to as HA) that need to be completed based on personal life examples and work projects. In each HA, you need to practice thinking through writing^[Thinking through writing is the primary method for learning the complex methodology: if you're not writing, you're likely not learning. Completing HA in writing means engaging and developing your intellect.] and, as a result, publish a draft (post) in the AISystant club. In the draft, use notes and drafts that you write during the course study.

When doing homework, **it is essential to** **model** using the appropriate tables. This work serves as a "training ground for systems thinking." Systems thinking is fostered through:

* studying theory (concepts, principles, thinking techniques) outlined in the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course;
* modeling based on examples provided in the homework;
* modeling several of your real projects, which you will primarily implement during the second semester.

Each homework contains several **modeling exercises in the form of template tables** that you must fill out using provided examples. Template table headings represent meta-meta-models ("from the textbook") to describe certain project activities, whereas the content of the filled tables usually consists of meta-models or models from a specific applied subject area. While filling the template tables, you engage in modeling.

Almost all template tables are divided into the following blocks:

* an example of a filled-in table that you need to study thoroughly, paying attention to the connection of systems thinking concepts in the table headings with real-life examples;
* an assignment to fill in missing cells following the example;
* an assignment to model a work project;
* an assignment to model a project from personal life (for example, systems related to body, teeth, core, workplace, etc.).

As part of the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course with an instructor, you'll study the corresponding online course, model simple personal and work projects in tables, and receive instructor feedback. By the end of the course, it's preferable to write a final systems essay.

Systems thinking is no simpler than mathematical analysis. Nonetheless, even a not-so-brilliant student managed to grasp it through specific self-development practices. Therefore, each student in the course will need to undertake the following independent work:

* organize systematic slow reading of each section of the online course and additional literature throughout the week (preferably doing this daily instead of reading everything at once) and compose educational notes^[On the Aisystant platform, educational notes are automatically sent to the club, where they can be compiled into drafts and later crafted into a post draft, also published in the club.];
* systematically practice thinking through writing during HA completion and write 8 drafts (one for each of the seven sections and a final draft on course completion);
* rearrange your current schedule, allocating 10–15 hours each week for 2 months to study the course^[If a comfortable and unhurried pace is important to you, tackle one section per week. If you have more time, the course can be completed faster. However, it's recommended to dedicate at least a month to thoroughly complete all HA.], and maintain a daily routine during this time^[If you don't change your schedule and, for instance, don't get enough rest and sleep, or don't maintain a healthy lifestyle, you might not have enough energy for demanding intellectual work.];
* keep a constant record of the time invested in learning according to the schedule and allotted slots for each day of the week.

Pay attention to **personal** **organization**: systematic HA completion, planning, and time management for learning. It's crucial to keep track of the total amount of time invested to adapt to advanced learning and see an initial positive outcome in the form of a completed plan for time investments in the course^[Substantive results in work projects and life overall will appear later. You’ll need to endure until you encounter them. Focus on time investment to achieve results.]. After this phase, you will gain a deeper understanding of the essence of systems methodology.

During the course, it will be beneficial for you to broaden your activity horizon, particularly by learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work products across various activity domains. You have a decent grasp in anatomy (system "organism"), but you may be less familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. Systems thinking is not deskwork; you will need to engage in many conversations with different people. Don’t postpone this; start today. For example, write, call, or talk over coffee with colleagues or friends. Furthermore, **use our** **AI bot** **Aisystant,** **ChatGPT,** and **Google**.

I hope your first step into systems thinking is fruitful and that you discover a methodology that can profoundly change your worldview and life.

**To complete homework assignments, use your personal workspace for modeling:**
