## Course Overview: Introduction to Systems Thinking

The "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course is your gateway into the fascinating world of systems thinking. During this course, you'll become familiar with the **main concepts** of systems thinking and start applying them to both professional and personal projects.

You can take the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course **independently or as part of group learning with an instructor**. If you enroll with an instructor, you'll receive feedback on all your questions and have your homework reviewed. The instructor will help you navigate the numerous pitfalls, clarify complex points, and accelerate your understanding of the intricate systems thinking.

The course is divided into 7 sections[^1] and includes 7 homework assignments (referred to as HW), which should be approached using personal life examples and work projects. Each HW requires practicing thinking through writing[^2], and the results should be shared as a draft (post) in the AISYSTANT club. Utilize the notes and drafts you create during the course study in your draft.

When completing the homework, it is **strongly recommended** to **model** using the appropriate tables. This activity serves as a "systems thinking simulator." The formation of systems thinking occurs through:

- studying the theory (concepts, principles, thinking techniques) presented in the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course;
- modeling based on the examples outlined in the homework;
- modeling on several of your real-life projects, predominantly carried out during the second semester.

Each homework assignment includes multiple **modeling exercises in the form of template tables**, which must be filled out based on given examples. The template table headings serve as meta-meta-models ("from the textbook") for describing some project activity, while the content of the filled tables usually represents meta-models or models (from some applied subject area). As you fill out these template tables, you are engaging in modeling.

Practically all template tables are divided into the following blocks:

- a table filling example that you must study, observing the connection between systems thinking concepts in the table header and real-life examples;
- an assignment to fill in the missing cells based on the example;
- an assignment for modeling a work project;
- an assignment for modeling a personal life project (e.g., for systems like body, teeth, abs, workplace, etc.).

In the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course with an instructor, you'll study the corresponding online course, model simple personal and work projects in tables, and also receive feedback from the instructor. It's advisable to write a final systems essay by the end of the course.

Systems thinking is no simpler than mathematical analysis. Nevertheless, even a not-so-outstanding student managed to master it through certain self-development practices. Therefore, as part of the course, each student will need to undertake the **following independent work**:

- organize systematic slow reading of each section of the online course and supplementary literature over a week (preferably daily, rather than reading it all in one day) and make educational notes[^3];
- consistently practice thinking through writing when completing HW and write 8 drafts (one for each of the seven sections and a final draft on completing the course);
- adjust your current schedule to allocate 10–15 hours per week over 2 months for course study[^4] and maintain a daily routine during this time[^5];
- keep a constant record of the time invested in learning according to the schedule and allocated slots for each day of the week.

Pay **attention to** **personal** **organization**: consistently completing HW, planning, and time management for learning. It's crucial to focus on the total time investment to adapt to demanding learning and see early positive results in the form of a completed time investment plan for the course[^6]. After this, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the essence of systems methodology.

Throughout the course, expanding your activity horizon will be beneficial, specifically learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work products across various activity fields. You probably have a decent activity horizon in anatomy (the "organism" system) but are likely less familiar with terms used in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. Systems thinking is not an office-bound task; you’ll need to engage with many people! Don't put this off for the future—start today. For example, write, call, or have a chat over coffee with colleagues or friends. Additionally, **use our** **AI** **assistant** **Aisystant**, **ChatGPT**, and **Google**.

I hope your first step into systems thinking will be fruitful, and you'll discover a methodology that truly transforms your worldview and life.

**To complete homework, use a personal workspace for modeling:**

[^1]: We strongly recommend equipping yourself with a pen or taking notes on a computer while reading. It's proven that consuming information while simultaneously noting arising ideas and questions enhances learning effectiveness.
[^2]: Thinking through writing is the primary method for mastering complex methodology: if you’re not writing, you’re likely not learning. If you complete HW in writing, it means you’re engaging and developing your intellect.
[^3]: On the Aisystant platform, educational notes are automatically sent to the club, where they can be compiled into drafts and later into a post draft, which should also be published in the club.
[^4]: If you prefer a comfortable and leisurely pace: cover one section per week. If you have more time available, the course can be completed more swiftly. However, it’s recommended to dedicate at least a month to the course to thoroughly complete all HW.
[^5]: Failing to adjust your schedule, such as not getting enough rest and sleep or maintaining a healthy lifestyle, might lead to a lack of energy for demanding intellectual work.
[^6]: Substantive results in work projects and life as a whole will appear later. You will need to persevere until reaching them. Focusing on the time investment will help achieve results.
