Please refer to the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Note that the provided data can apply to a wide range of situations, and you only need to describe one possible scenario. The key is to avoid making obvious mistakes in methodology.

Provide examples of chains related to meta-modeling for objects in your project, following the pattern in the first row. Don't worry too much about distinguishing between functional and constructive objects and their types. It's important to differentiate between a real object from the physical world of the project, its type from the discipline in the project's subject area, and the discipline type from the intelligence stack (from our textbook). Moreover, understand their alignment beyond just differentiation.

**Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by the given number and complete all its tasks.**
