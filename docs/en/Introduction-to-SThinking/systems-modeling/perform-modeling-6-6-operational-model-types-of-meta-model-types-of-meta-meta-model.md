Please review the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Keep in mind that the presented data can apply to a wide range of situations, so it's sufficient to describe any one scenario. The key is to avoid making obvious mistakes.

Provide examples of chains in relation to meta-modeling for objects from your project, following the pattern in the first row. Don't worry too much about distinguishing between functional and constructive objects and their types. What's important is to differentiate between the real object from the physical world of the project, its type from the discipline in the project's subject area, and the type of discipline from the intelligence stack (from our textbook) â€” and in addition to distinguishing them, understand their correspondence.
