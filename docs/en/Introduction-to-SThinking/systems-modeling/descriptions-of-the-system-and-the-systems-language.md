### Translation

In the diagram from the "Systems Thinking" textbook, the majority of systems thinking concepts we've already discussed are illustrated. Mastery in systems thinking, which allows you to apply it to work projects, means you can **easily see the connections between these concepts**. This diagram highlights seven main concepts (alphas^[The OMG Essence standard (http://www.omg.org/spec/Essence/) presents a special type of functional objects for monitoring project status changes â€” an alpha (ALPHA or Abstract-Level Progress Health Attribute). An alpha is an object of focus whose functional/role nature aligns with the interests of "how the project works" (not the target system, but the project, i.e., systems in creation). If we want to coherently think about how a project operates, how the target system is created, and then developed by its creators during their work, we need to focus on alphas within the project, not just any arbitrary objects.]) with color, while other concepts and sub-alphas are not highlighted, but you can see that all concepts are interconnected. Most of the connections culminate in the realization of the system. This is our successful system, for which we study systems thinking with all its systems concepts.

You might think that such an approach is somewhat excessive. But imagine an analogy and create a commonplace conceptual network based on a car. Adults possess fluency in thinking regarding the concept of a "car," not in terms of a systems approach but simply as a subject area. You're likely to quickly identify concepts like fuel, movement, weather, passenger, environment, luxury, winter tires, and many others that help explain activities related to a car.

You can easily draw a diagram where all these concepts are interconnected^[Fuel is poured into the car's fuel tank. In this simple sentence, I described the physical world. I used concepts like "fuel" and "fuel tank" and linked them with another action concept, "poured." The fact is, you're familiar with these concepts, and your mind connects them effortlessly, quickly modeling the physical world. If suddenly the fuel starts leaking from the fuel tank, you would take certain actions. These actions can also be described with a specific model.]. For a 17th-century person, many vehicle-related terms would be utterly confusing. But you handle these concepts with ease because you live among them. Similarly, it is recommended to **"immerse yourself" in systems thinking concepts** to create successful systems in personal life and work projects. Proficiency in systems concepts means you quickly locate them in your project, such as the target system or the method of description for the subject of interest "price" or "safety"^[Similarly, in everyday life, you fluently use the concepts of "mom" and "dad," and when you visit a friend's house, you quickly understand who is who.].

The use of systems concepts is crucial for **creating (modeling) systems descriptions** necessary for developing successful systems. It is essential to provide descriptions for all areas of interest of the supersystem, the target system, and the creator.

In this section, we will focus on the following:

* How to **describe any systems** **using systems language,** including role descriptions, models, description methods, etc.;
* We will learn about the four main descriptions of a system as a transparent box that addresses **subjects of interest within any system's internal structure**;
* What documentation exists for **areas of interest** in **three types** of **systems**.
