title: The Connection of the Description Method with Subject of Interest, Project
  Roles, and the System
---

In previous sections, it was mentioned that the **subject of interest** is connected to the system. Various subjects of interest can characterize a system. These interests are linked to **project roles**, meaning that people in these roles are concerned with certain characteristics of the system.

The **team** decides which interests of the project roles^[Among all considered project roles, the subjects of interest and/or preferences that will be addressed are selected. It's impossible to satisfy all interests because resources (funds and time) may be limited. However, the team must avoid making an obvious mistake. An obvious mistake would be failing to account for a certain interest, leading to significant and irreparable costs later.] will be addressed during the creation of the system. This decision affects what **work products** (**documentation**) will be needed. Work products are the physical carriers that contain the system description corresponding to a specific subject of interest.

To create the documentation, one must possess a certain practice^[As you may recall, the project role creates the work product based on practice.] or method of description. Through this **method of description**, a system description is created on a physical carrier, responding to the subject of interest in the system.

For example, a racer's interest is in the speed of the car. This can also be stated differently: the external project role of "racer" has a subject of interest in the "speed" of the "car" system. The developers decided to satisfy the racer's interests, meaning the team determined that the interests of this particular project role should be addressed. Consequently, work will continue with this subject of interest, resulting in the creation of documentation (a computer model).

Next, the developers choose a method of description to create the system description. They select a method that allows for the construction of a computer model to calculate the car's speed^[Here, both the theoretical aspects of calculations and the computer-based aspects of how these calculations can be conducted are important.]. This computer model is a work product containing a system description of the car concerning the subject of interestâ€”speed.

Incidentally, this model can consider not only the given subject of interest but also others. The total number of work products (documentation) for system descriptions is proportional to the number of subjects of interest, and **the number of subjects of interest is proportional to the number of project roles** that have been chosen to address^[As you recall, all project roles are considered, but the team may decide that only selected ones will be addressed. For each, a work product is created to satisfy the project role. The diagram shows only the external project role, but the same applies to the internal project role.].
