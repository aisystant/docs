**System Modeling** is the **process of creating descriptions** of a **system** that helps to understand and explain the complexity and structure within the system, as well as the interaction of the system with its external environment. Modeling involves describing only the essentials and omitting the non-essential parts. Documenting models allows the team to focus on what is important, while the less critical elements remain in discussions.

Role descriptions collectively form the **System Documentation**, created through a **method of description**. Most of you are involved in modeling and creating documentation for various systems. Therefore, it's important to understand the methods of description you use and work on improving them. This is what applied mastery is about. However, systems thinking, in particular, can help you focus on these methods and incorporate them into the project activities of your department or the entire company if needed.

There can be numerous descriptions of systems, and a system can be described as both a **“black” box** and a **“transparent” box**. One of the important descriptions of the external behavior of a system is the usage concept. When discussing the internal structure of a system, we identify four main descriptions: functional, modular, locational (placement), and financial (resource).

High-level **modeling** within project activities involves identifying all important systems and subsystems as well as understanding their interconnections. In each cell of the 3x3 Table, specific documents with descriptions for different areas of interest can be highlighted.

**Main Concepts:** System Documentation; modeling, method of description, subject of interest; model, meta-model, multi-model, mega-model; functional=role-based=analytical; modular=constructive=synthetic; spatial=locational=placement; cost-based=economic=resource; functional description, modular description, spatial description.
