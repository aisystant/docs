**Systems Modeling** is the **process of creating** **system descriptions** that help understand and explain the complexity and structure within a system, as well as the system's interaction with the external environment. Modeling involves highlighting only the most critical aspects while omitting the insignificant ones. Documenting models ensures that the essential elements are kept in the team's focus, while the non-essential elements remain only as part of discussions.

Role descriptions, collectively forming the **system description**, are created through **the method of description**. Many of you are engaged in modeling and creating documentation for various systems. Therefore, it's crucial to understand the methods of description you are using and strive to enhance them. This is what applied mastery involves. Notably, systems thinking will help focus on these methods and integrate them, if necessary, into your division’s or entire company’s project activities.

There can be numerous system descriptions, and a system can be described as a **"black box"** or **"transparent box."** One important description of the system's external behavior is the concept of use. When discussing the internal structure of a system, we emphasize four main descriptions: functional, modular, spatial (placement), and financial (resource-based).

In **high-level** **modeling** within project activities, we include the identification of all important systems and subsystems and an understanding of their interconnections. In each cell of the 3x3 Table, specific documents can be highlighted with descriptions across various subjects of interest.

**Main Concepts:** system description; modeling; method of description; subject of interest; model, meta-model, multi-model, mega-model; functional=role-based=analytical; modular=constructive=synthetic; spatial=places=placement; cost-based=economic=resource-based; functional description, modular description, spatial description.
