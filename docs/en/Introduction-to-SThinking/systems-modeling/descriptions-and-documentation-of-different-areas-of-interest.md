### How to Think About Systems: Exploring Descriptions

In the final subsection of "How to Think About Systems?" we explored approaches to **describing any system** as a "black box" and a "transparent box"^[These approaches apply to the target system, supersystem, our system, or the system of creation.]. These concepts were discussed in previous sections. In this subsection, we'll delve into specific types of descriptions related to different areas of interest in **project activities**.

In project activities (or within an enterprise), **you're surrounded by a multitude of various documents describing various systems**^[At different systemic levels or creation chains.]. Additionally, multiple projects occur simultaneously within an enterprise, and you may be involved in several. In your daily work, you might not necessarily or consistently describe the target system. For instance, you might describe the clientele, create certain subsystems of the production line for the target system, or simply fill out financial templates.

Refer back to the 3x3 Table and pay attention to the listing of work products in each cell. Examine each cell and try to identify your cell(s) and the work products you work with and create.

For example, note that the target system as a "black box" in terms of its role behavior (cell 1.2 of the 3x3 Table) is described as a "usage concept." While your specific enterprise might not use this exact term, "usage concept" might be referred to differently^[Documentation of the usage concept might be named differently across enterprises: standards documents, use cases, technical specifications, files with scenario diagrams in various languages, database fragments with information models.]. **The exact name of the work product in each cell** **of the 3x3 Table** **also depends** **on the subject area and the chosen method of description**. If you are creating a car, you'll use one set of descriptive methods across the cells; if it's an IT system, you'll use another.

Systems thinking can enhance your communication with specialists, but you also need to consciously^[Awareness arises when you focus on your roles, best practices (SOTA methods), subjects of interest and preferences, work products, etc.] understand your **subject area**, including reaching into the physical world. This means knowing from which cell of the 3x3 Table you view other project roles^[All other team members or external project roles.] and with which work products you communicate with them.

If you are unaware of your subject area and cannot extend your thoughts into changes in the physical world (i.e., the specific work products), this is a direct route to failure. You'll end up describing strange things, implementing random changes in the physical world, or not addressing the physical world with your ideas at all.

Our course highlights that there are different areas of interest, and in each, certain documentation is created using specific descriptive methods. Every enterprise has **employees specializing in specific subject areas** who use descriptive methods to create this documentation.

For example, a marketer (in cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table) creates a description of the target audience. From our course, you understand what this documentation entails, the role it serves, and for whom this work product is created. You should also understand that clientele is a system in the real/physical world, while a computer CRM system is to the clientele as a photograph is to a personâ€”a document with a description and convenient viewing tools.

However, you are unlikely to create this "clientele" system or even its descriptive documentation if you are not the corresponding specialist. The same applies to all other cells of the 3x3 Table. **In our course, you received** **a high-level understanding** **of all areas of interest and studied a universal** **approach to modeling** any system. But specific modeling and system creation are carried out by applied specialists. The good news is that now you know how to interact with them. You understand their subjects of interest, methods, work products, and so on.
