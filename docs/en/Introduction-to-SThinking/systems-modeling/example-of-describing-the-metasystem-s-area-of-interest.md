title: Example of Describing the Super-System's Area of Interest
---

### Let’s consider an example of one of the descriptions from cell 1.1 of the 3x3 Table.

In marketing, there is frequent discussion about concepts like **customer problems or dissatisfactions** (target audience). These are key concepts in entrepreneurial activities, but it's vital to understand how they connect to the systems concept within the scope of interests of the supersystem, such as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For instance, a marketer identifies a **group of individuals or agents** (such as companies) who may potentially assume external project roles related to clientele (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group of individuals or agents is referred to as the target audience or target group. There are practical marketing practices^[These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and create a customer profile. However, we will not cover such practical practices in this course.], which allow for the description of potential representatives of the target audience. For example, they describe their problems and dissatisfactions and create a customer profile.

Sometimes, there is reference to needs as included in Maslow’s hierarchy. It is crucial, however, not to confuse the same term "need" in the context of Maslow’s theory^[<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Пирамида_потребностей_по_Маслоу>] and in the context of systems thinking: the former pertains to the agent, while the latter to the project role. Henceforth, a need according to Maslow will be called an **agent's dissatisfaction** (or problem), and we will use the term "need" strictly when referring to the **needs of external project roles** (not the agent).

Descriptions of agents use characteristics such as age, gender^[Although contemporary marketing theories advise against relying on such characteristics, focusing more on agents' behavioral factors.], place of residence, social status, skills, education, and available resources (weekly time, finances), among others. These characteristics are essential for understanding the "intentions" of these individuals. The primary goal of marketing is to ensure that people from the target audience assume the role of buyer and subsequently the role of user.

Therefore, it's crucial to separately examine:

- the **dissatisfactions and problems** of individuals from the target audience^[With specific people as representatives of the target audience. People's dissatisfactions are not only described in Maslow’s hierarchy. Here are several more sources: <https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory>, <https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/>. Note that there is no pyramid involved here.];
- the **needs of external project roles** that individuals from this target audience fulfill.

Problems and dissatisfactions place (encourage, stimulate) individuals into certain project roles, and when they begin to act according to these project roles, they exhibit corresponding needs. In different roles, these same individuals may have entirely different needs.

This example further illustrates the necessity of paying close attention to concepts from various theories and how systems thinking enables quick understanding of these concepts and connects them with one another.
