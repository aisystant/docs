Please review the example in the first row of the table, and fill in the blank cells in the rows that follow. You might not always know the exact name of the description method, so express its main characteristic (action). If necessary, use tools like ChatGPT and Google. During the course, it will be beneficial for you to broaden your professional (activity) horizon, specifically by learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work products across various fields. Note that while you have a good professional horizon in medicine, you might not be as familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from your work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further processing. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section.
