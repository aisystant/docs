title: 'Perform Modeling: 6.7. Functional and Structural Descriptions'
---

Here is one example of descriptions related to the area of interest for the target system.

Review the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to fully understand the distinction between functional parts and product (modular) parts. If needed, use the AI bot Aisystant. Fill in the empty cells following the example in the first row. If you find that your perspective isn't broad enough to select the appropriate words and labels (names), you can use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Provide five examples of different functional and structural breakdowns (like for scissors) for various systems.

Include examples from both work and personal projects.

**Locate the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its requirements.**
