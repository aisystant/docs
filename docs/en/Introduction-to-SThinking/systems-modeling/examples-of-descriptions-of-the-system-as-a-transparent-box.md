title: Examples of Descriptions of the System as a Transparent Box
---

Let's examine three descriptions using the example of a clock^[Image created by A. Turkhanov.].

**Functional Description** – This involves describing subsystems as role-based or functional objects. A functional description demonstrates "how the system works internally." For example, a functional diagram illustrates how the clock operates. Notice that in this diagram, there are no modules, as we are focused on the functional parts of the clock, which demonstrate their functional or role-based behavior.

**Constructive or physical modules** – These are the objects assembled to form the clock system. A modular description or breakdown demonstrates what the system is composed of. As you can see, the modular diagram shows various constructive parts of the system. While it does not clarify how the clock functions, it clearly shows how to assemble the clock using gears, springs, hands, and other components.

The third description is of the **spatial placement of parts**, indicating where system components are located within space. Understanding the exact location of modules in the universe is crucial, as without this knowledge, the system won't function.

**System levels are determined by functional decomposition — which is central to systems thinking**! Thus, functional decomposition is often referred to as systemic separation. What about the others? Those are regular breakdowns. It's also essential to remember there are modular and spatial breakdowns.

As you can see, systems at each systemic level interact with one another as functional objects. This interaction is described by a functional diagram. At the same systemic level, you can identify specific physical objects that perform these functions (or play the role of functional objects). These physical objects are situated somewhere in space. When we shift to another systemic level, the situation will be quite similar.

For instance, we can identify functional, physical objects, and their locations at the subsystem level of an engine. Then, we can identify functional, physical objects and their locations at the level of the entire car. Here, we won't delve into the engine's structure anymore, as it becomes part of the car system. However, from a functional perspective, the engine system should produce torque^[In common cultural terms, the functional object "system-engine" is called the "engine." Its role is to move. Internal combustion engines move by transmitting torque to the chassis.]. Additionally, from a physical perspective, it can be viewed as the gasoline engine BD-1324. We can move up another level, where other functional and physical objects and their locations exist.

The next example pertains to the **human-actor system**, capable of creating successful systems across various projects. An actor has functional behavior—life mastery. Life mastery comprises the following functional components:

* thinking mastery or intelligence;
* applied skills.

Another example involves the functional parts of a car system, such as the chassis, body, and engine. Here, further systemic decomposition can be performed to examine the chassis structure, thereby identifying the next systemic level.
