You already know that a systems concept description consists of role descriptions, which in turn consist of models. To create a role description, a method of description (practice) is necessary. This method of description is represented as **a theory** that explains how to create system descriptions and the necessary **tools** to produce a functional product (system documentation). In the theory, metamodels are established, which are filled with data and thus become models. Models can be in various formats, like on paper or in a computer. In this context, we refer to documentation.

It's easiest to think of the method of description from a substantive point of view as a set of notations for multi-layer map models that describe a territory. The territory is the system, and the map represents documentation with a system description, but there's a specific method for creating the map^[For instance, the photogrammetric method for creating topographic maps.], involving metamodels, concepts, principles, etc. The theory for crafting this description, along with the technology for creating the map, constitutes the method of description.

The **universality** of the **high-level modeling approach** means that descriptions are made in response to a specific subject of interest (or preference) to a particular system, and for this, the role(s) use a specific method of description to produce documentation aimed at another role. For example, a topological map is created in response to the interest in the "relief" of the "territory" system (an area of land). Topographers create the map, while surveyors, geologists, geographers, or even designers planning a house project might use it.

The method of description allows for creating descriptions of any systems. Of course, primary attention should focus on the target system, but in **project activities or at the enterprise you will encounter numerous documents describing a wide variety of systems** (super-systems, subsystems, creation systems, and so on).

In the table above, you can see **the connection of the concepts role, interest, role description, and method of description**. Note that you may often have encountered similar role descriptions in the form of documents. Many of you are proficient in various description methods, through which you create specific documents. Be sure to describe your roles, methods of description, and work products in the corresponding modeling exercise from the course.

Different roles may share an interest, yet have different role descriptions. A single role may have several interests. It is possible to create one description that addresses multiple **subjects of interest**.

Choosing the right method of description is crucial. For instance, tax, financial, and managerial descriptions require different methods. For tax purposes, tax and accounting are needed, for financial description, IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP is required, while managerial accounting methods are used for financial-management descriptions. Note that all three descriptions (methods and work products) are created for three different roles â€“ the tax officer, shareholder, and manager.

You well understand that **quality role descriptions cannot be made without explicitly considering the role's method of description and corresponding documentation**. It means they cannot be done unconsciously. Awareness in applying the method of description increases the probability that you'll recognize the need to master a new method in time.
