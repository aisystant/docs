You already know that the outcome of modeling consists of **models** that can exist on various physical media. A model helps to form a judgment about the object being modeled. The object being modeled is a target system, as well as other types of systems. Models exist for a supersystem, creation systems, systems in the environment, or subsystems.

Let's emphasize once again that models are created using a specific method of description. This method indicates what is most important in the object being modeled and what needs to be considered in the models. This "most important" feature for a particular model is called a **meta-model**.

For example, consider the systemâ€”Moscow city. And there is a map of the city. The map is a model of Moscow city. The legend of the map serves as the **meta-model**. The map contains only a tiny fraction of information about the city, yet it reflects the most critical information that someone decided to highlight. One map might present the city's districts, another might show roads and industrial facilities, and a third might highlight water protection zones, and so on.

The legend of each such map indicates what is significant in those areas and what should be represented in those specific models. You will see roads on the map, as they are important, but not the width of the roads, since it was not deemed necessary by the map's creator for that particular map.

A collection of interrelated models created using different description methods is usually called a **multi-model**. It's like a collection of various maps for the same territory: flora, fauna, population density, terrain, road networks, etc.

In addition to a set of maps, we also need a set of legends for these maps. A multi-model combined with its defining meta-models is referred to as a **mega-model**.

For more details on models, meta-models, multi-models, and mega-models, refer to the textbook "Systems Thinking." It's an excellent resource for broadening one's perspective. Furthermore, it's essential to apply these concepts in project activities.

It's advisable to identify (and correct) system model errors during the description and documentation phase before the system's creation, rather than afterward, and certainly not during the system's operation. As the saying goes: describe seven times, create once!
