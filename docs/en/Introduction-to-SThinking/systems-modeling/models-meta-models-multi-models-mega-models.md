title: Models, Meta-Models, Multi-Models, Mega-Models

You already know that the result of modeling is **models** that can exist on different physical mediums. A model helps form a judgment about the object being modeled. The object being modeled is the target system, along with other types of systems. Models are present in the supersystem, in systems of creation, in systems within the environment, or in subsystems.

Let's emphasize once more that models are created using a specific method of description. This method indicates what is most important in the object being modeled and what needs to be considered in the models. This "most important" aspect of a model is called a **meta-model**.

For instance, consider the system â€” the city of Moscow. Then, there is a map of the city. The map is a model of the city of Moscow. The legend of the map is the **meta-model**. The map contains a minuscule amount of information about the city, but it's the most important information that someone decided to include. One map may illustrate the city's districts, another the roads and industrial sites, and yet another the protected water zones, etc.

The legend of each such map indicates what is important in the areas and what must be displayed specifically in these models. You will see the road on the map, as it's important, but its width won't be shown, because it wasn't deemed important for that specific map's creator.

A collection of interconnected models, made using different methods of description, is typically called a **multi-model**. It's like an anthology of various maps for the same area: flora, fauna, population density, terrain, road network, etc.

Along with a collection of maps, we also need a set of legends for these maps. A multi-model combined with its defining meta-models is referred to as a **mega-model**.

For more details on models, meta-models, multi-models, and mega-models, read the textbook "Systems Thinking." It's valuable for broadening your perspectives. Following that, it's essential to apply these concepts in project activities.

Errors in a system model should ideally be detected (and corrected) during the description and documentation of the system, before its creation, and certainly not during its operation. As the saying goes: measure twice, cut once!
