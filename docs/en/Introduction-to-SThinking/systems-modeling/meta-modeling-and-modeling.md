title: Meta-Modeling and Modeling
---

In our textbook, we introduce **meta-meta-models**. For example, the concept of "system" is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are studied specifically in transdisciplines. Next, you delve into the specific domain, where you find **meta-models**. For example, in education, the target system is the concept of mastery, while in the transportation industry, it is the vehicle. To clarify, this could mean mastery of organization (or accounting mastery) and a passenger car, respectively.

We then proceed to create a **model**—the description of John's mastery or a model of the BMW X6 car. The actual mastery of John or the specific BMW X6 car itself is considered the **system** (the physical object). It is also referred to as the target system, a term from the meta-meta-model.

These concepts are used not only in systems thinking. Our language is structured similarly. For example, we can say that the concept of "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The concept "mother" is a meta-meta-model to identify a living creature with children.

In a zoo, the term "mother of the cub" is a meta-model from the domain of the animal world (not human). A meta-model can also be "mother of tiger cubs."

A record in the zoo's database stating “Maya the tigress, mother of Mursik the cub” is a model. A photograph of Maya the tigress or a sculpture of her is also a model.

The tigress Maya, who has become a mother, is a physical 4D object in the zoo. Maya is the "mother of the cub" and a "mother." However, not all "mothers" are "mothers of cubs," and not all "mothers of cubs" are Maya.

This is covered in the course "Rational Work," and is further applied in systems thinking. You already have the ability to distinguish systems from processes, roles from executors, models from meta-models, etc. For more effective training in systems thinking, it is recommended to use our course as a practice tool (engage in modeling), which helps you gain experience and get accustomed to modeling^[Systems thinking formally manifests as “thinking through writing” or “thinking through modeling.” Modeling tasks or filling out tables in the course are the next step in advancing systems thinking (after learning the systems concept).].

Previously, we mentioned that establishing systems thinking begins with learning systems concepts^[Including understanding how they interconnect.]. Now, **you are more consciously focusing on** **modeling techniques**, and will later engage in meta-modeling. Meta-modeling involves creating table templates, which means defining the names of rows and/or columns of the table (the properties of the table). This is the work course developers did to create universal tables. As directors of development, you will create similar tables for your employees based on your workplace projects^[You may borrow some tables from the course, but you can also create your unique tables with terms from your applied field.]. For the moment, you are working on modeling, i.e., filling out the course's tables^[Beautiful diagrams with squares and arrows are the popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables and even text are more adequate and systematic for complex projects and systems.]. To do this, it's essential to know the subject field, as the tables reflect specific work activities and apply terms of practical methods.

Thus, to establish systems thinking, learning the system language, modeling, and meta-modeling are necessary. We recommend doing this through thinking by writing and working with tables rather than diagrams: fill out and create tables for your work projects. Therefore, **use your working time for modeling and meta-modeling,** as it's not possible to learn to drive a car in a closed training area—so students are almost immediately sent to city roads. Therefore, use modeling tools (Coda or at least our course as a training tool) directly in your working environment.
