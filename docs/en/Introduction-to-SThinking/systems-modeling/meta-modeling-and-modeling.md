title: Meta-Modeling and Modeling
---

In our textbook, we present **meta-meta-models**. For instance, the concept of a “system” is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are studied specifically in transdisciplinary fields. Then, you dive into the subject area, which encompasses **meta-models**. For instance, the target system in education is the concept of mastery, and in the transportation industry, it is a vehicle. More specifically, this could refer to the skillfulness of being systematic (or accounting expertise) and a passenger car, respectively.

Next, we create a **model**—such as a description of John's skill or a model of a BMW X6 car. The actual skill (not the concept) of John or the specific BMW X6 car is the **system** itself (the physical object), referred to as the target system (a term from the meta-meta-model).

These concepts are not restricted to systems thinking. Our language operates similarly. For example, the concept of "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The term “mother” serves as a meta-meta-model to denote a living creature that has children.

In a zoo, the concept of “mother of an animal” is a meta-model within the domain of the animal kingdom (non-human). A meta-model can also be “mother of tiger cubs.”

An entry in the zoo’s database—“tigress Maya, mother of cub Murzik”—is a model. A photograph of tigress Maya or a sculpture of her is also a model.

The tigress Maya, who became a mother, is a physical 4D object in the zoo. Tigress Maya is the “mother of an animal” and just a “mother.” But not all “mothers” are “mothers of animals,” and not all “mothers of animals” are tigress Maya.

All these concepts are covered in the course “Rational Work,” which is later used in systems thinking. You can already distinguish between systems and processes, roles and executors, models and meta-models, and so on. To better train in systems thinking, we recommend using our course as a practice tool (engaging in modeling) to gain proficiency and get accustomed to modeling^[Systems thinking as a form manifests as “thinking through writing” or “thinking through modeling.” Modeling tasks or filling out tables in the course are the next step towards developing systems thinking (after studying systems concepts).].

We previously mentioned that the establishment of systems thinking starts with the study of systems concepts^[Including understanding their interconnections.]. Now **you are paying more conscious attention** to **modeling techniques**, and will later engage in meta-modeling. Meta-modeling involves creating table templates, determining the names for the rows and/or columns of the table (the properties of the table). This is the work the course developers undertook to create universal tables, and as directors of development, you will create similar tables for your employees for your work projects^[Some tables you will adopt from the course, but you can also create unique tables with applied domain concepts.]. For now, you are engaged in modeling, i.e., filling out course tables^[Beautiful diagrams with squares and arrows are the popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables and even texts are more appropriate and systematic for complex projects and systems.]. For this, it is necessary to understand the subject area, as the tables reflect specific work activities and use concepts from applied methods.

Thus, to establish systems thinking, it’s essential to study the systems language, modeling, and meta-modeling. We recommend doing this by thinking through writing and working with tables instead of diagrams: filling in and creating tables for your work projects. Therefore, **use your work time for modeling and meta-modeling,** as it’s impossible to learn to drive a car on a practice range alone—which is why students are almost immediately sent onto city roads. Therefore, use the modeling tool (Coda or at least our course as a simulator) directly in your work environments.
