title: Example Description of the Supersystem's Area of Interest
---

Let's consider an example of a description for cell 1.1 in the 3x3 Table.

In marketing, terms like **customers' issues or dissatisfactions** (target audience) are often discussed. These are important concepts from entrepreneurial activities, but it's necessary to understand how they are connected with systems concepts of the supersystem's areas of interest, such as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For instance, a marketer identifies a **group of people or agents** (such as companies) who can potentially assume external project roles related to clientele (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group is referred to as the target audience or target group. There are applied marketing practices^[These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and create a customer profile. However, we will not discuss such applied practices in this course.] that allow for the description of potential representatives of the target audience. For example, they describe their issues and dissatisfactions and create a customer profile.

Occasionally, needs that fit into Maslow's hierarchy are discussed. It's crucial not to confuse the same term "need" in the context of Maslow's theory^[<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Пирамида_потребностей_по_Маслоу>] with its context in systems thinking: the former pertains to the agent, while the latter pertains to the project role. Henceforth, Maslow's need will be referred to as the agent's **dissatisfaction** (or problem), and the term "need" will be reserved for discussing **the needs of external project roles** (not the agent).

Describing agents involves characteristics like age, gender^[Although modern marketing theories suggest avoiding such characteristics and instead focusing more on agents' behavioral factors.], residence, social status, competencies, education, existing resources (weekly time, finances), etc. These characteristics are essential to understand these individuals' "intentions." The main goal of marketing is to ensure that people from the target audience assume the role of buyer and later the role of user.

Therefore, it's necessary to individually address:

* the **dissatisfactions and issues** of people from the target audience^[Considering specific individuals as representatives of the target audience. People's dissatisfactions are not only described in Maslow's hierarchy. Here are some other sources: <https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory>, <https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/>. Notice, there is no pyramid involved.];
* the **needs of external project roles**, which people from this target audience play.

Problems and dissatisfactions place (compel, stimulate) people into certain project roles, and when they start acting in these project roles, they have corresponding needs. In other roles, the same people may have entirely different needs.

This example once again demonstrates the importance of careful consideration of concepts from different theories and how systems thinking helps quickly understand these concepts and relate them to one another.
