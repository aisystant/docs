title: Role Descriptions and Models
---

In the first section of the course, it was explained that a system has certain classic properties and depends on project roles. We then found out that there are numerous subjects of interest concerning the system, and each **description is made for a particular subject of interest**.

In the adapted diagram from **ISO 42010 standard**^[For more details about this standard, refer to the textbook "Systems Thinking".], you can see how to consider interests in the system, project roles, role description, models, and so on. This international standard provides guidelines on how to think about system description.

The standard itself talks only about architectural description, but its principles can be applied to any descriptions of different systems. For example, apply this scheme not to the target system, but to the system of creation.

In practice, everything usually starts with identifying the role-specific type of description, which stems from a particular interest. For instance, a business has **an interest in taxes**. There are certain project roles (each with its own methods and work products) that have this subject of interest. However, the preferences of a tax official, manager, and accountant in this interest may not align.

To address this subject of interest, a tax description is formed, which should include all the preferences of the project roles. Each project role has its own desires, but to reach an agreement, it's necessary to create a description common to all concerned^[That is, those having the same subject of interest.] project roles.

This description comprises specific models. Discussing tax matters is straightforward because many **metamodels** are standardized by the state in corresponding normative documents. These are documents like the "Balance Sheet," "Profit and Loss Statement," and others. When these metamodels are filled with the relevant reporting data, they become modelsâ€”descriptions of a particular business and its economic activities.

As you might have guessed, there is a specific **method of description** used to create this tax description. This is the method of accounting and tax reporting.

The state is concerned with taxes, so it advances its subject of interest through normative affirmation of description methods (metamodels) and meticulously reviews the models presented by accountants. Take a cue from tax officials on how to pay attention to modeling.

However, on the other hand, you must not forget for a moment that ultimately you require **the implementation of the system**, and the description given to us in the form of models, drawings, manufacturing instructions, etc., is only necessary because without a description, it is very difficult to bring a functioning system to life.
