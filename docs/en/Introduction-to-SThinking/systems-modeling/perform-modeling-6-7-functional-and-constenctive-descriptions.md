title: 'Execute Modeling: 6.7. Functional and Structural Descriptions'
---

This is an example of descriptions for the area of interest of the target system.

Please review the example in the first row of the table. It's recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the distinction between functional parts and product (modular) parts. If needed, use the AI bot Aisystant. Fill in the empty cells following the example in the first row. If you lack the expertise to find the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google to assist you. Provide five examples of different functional and constructive breakdowns of systems (similar to scissors).

Include examples from both work and personal projects.

**Locate the corresponding task by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its components.**
