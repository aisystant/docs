Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. You might not always know the exact name of the description method, so express its main characteristic (action). If needed, use ChatGPT and Google for assistance. Throughout the course, it would be beneficial for you to broaden your professional and operational perspective, particularly by learning about roles, methods, systems, and work products in various fields of activity. Note that you have a good scope of activity in medicine, but may be less familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section.

**Locate the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
