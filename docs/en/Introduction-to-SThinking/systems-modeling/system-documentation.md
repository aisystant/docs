title: System Documentation

The descriptions reflect **all the most important aspects of the system**, addressing all concerns and interests of project roles that the team has decided to satisfy during the system's creation. Developing a coherent description enhances the likelihood of implementing a successful target system in the physical world.

Systems modeling is carried out through **thinking through writing**, utilizing specialized tools known as **modelers**. These can include a pen and paper, Word, a wall with sticky notes and a marker, or more advanced modelers like Coda^[For high-level modeling that describes all significant systems and subsystems and their interconnections.], CAD (computer-aided design)^[For more detailed (domain-specific, applied) design, including the creation of engineering and technical documentation.], and so on.

The working product of systems modeling using these modelers is documentation.** This documentation ultimately serves as external memory for the team (exocortex)^[On one hand, modelers are also considered exocortex, but the result of modeling is also viewed as exocortex. This is an analogy with the brain, which processes thoughts, resulting in a conclusion stored in the brain. However, we consider documentation not as a biological brain but as paper or computer models accessible to individuals other than the developer.]. The **format of the documentation**^[The content of the documentation consists of descriptions determined by the interests of the project's roles in the system.] can include text, outlines, tables, computer models, etc.

Our course itself acts as a modeler in the form of tables or high-level models, weaving together essential concepts of systems thinking. Using the course as a training tool, you can practice mastering necessary concepts for such **high-level modeling** (not entirely related to the subject area). High-level modeling involves defining^[Name and brief description (such as function, structure, etc.).] all important systems and subsystems, along with their relationships. Additionally, understanding high-level models requires, at the very least, comprehension of the connection between the description method and interests, the difference between "black" and "transparent" boxes, and expanding one's knowledge about the names and content of key documents in major areas of interest^[For example, understanding what documents like 'Usage Concept' and 'System Concept' entail and how they differ from 'Balance Sheet' or 'Target Audience Description.'].

Subsequently, you can utilize any spreadsheet editor (like Coda) to describe your project's high-level aspects and systems involved. However, for domain-specific modeling and creating documents addressing role-related interests, applied theories and tools are necessary^[These require separate study. For instance, to compile a document like a balance sheet (addressing tax interests), you need to study accounting theory and master a tool (e.g., 1C).]. Examples include CAD, 1C, PDM (Product Data Management)^[A product data management system or product versioning system.], CRM (customer relationship management)^[CRM comprises databases describing the client base as an entire system in the physical world, with clients being individual components.], among many others.

Within our course, you'll learn about **the types of documents available, the interests they address, how they are interconnected, and which description methods are used to create them**. However, in this course^[And even within the systems thinking course.], you won't be studying and creating specific documents with models and descriptions. For example, while we'll discuss documents that describe target audiences or project roles, and concepts like usage and architecture, developing specific instances of these documents necessitates studying the relevant applied practices (description methods).

Usually, within a project or enterprise team, there are specialists in applied methods (marketers, architects, product owners, etc.) who specialize in developing documents describing various subjects of interest. The goal of our course is to appreciate that all these documents can be viewed similarly^[For instance, recognizing the roles creating them and understanding the methods used, or focusing on project roles the documentation is intended for.] and to perceive their interconnectedness, which requires mastering **systems language.** This means understanding the relevant systems modeling concepts.
