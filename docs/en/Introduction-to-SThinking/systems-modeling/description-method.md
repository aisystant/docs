You already know that a systems concept description is made up of role descriptions, which in turn consist of models. To create a role description, a method of description (a practice) is required. This method is represented as a **theory** that explains how to create system descriptions and the necessary **tools** to produce a functional product (documentation). Within the theory, metamodels are defined, filled with data, and thus become models. These models can exist on various media, like paper or computer files, and that’s when we discuss System Documentation.

The simplest way to think about a method of description from a substantive point of view is as a set of symbols for multilayered map-models that describe a territory. The territory is the system, the map is the documentation describing the system, but there's a method for creating the map^[For instance, the photogrammetric method for creating topographic maps.], which includes metamodels, concepts, principles, etc. The theory behind this description’s creation, along with the technology for map-making, constitutes the method of description.

The **universality** of the **high-level modeling** approach suggests that descriptions are produced in response to a particular subject of interest (or preference) concerning a specific system, and the role(s) employ a certain method of description for generating documentation aimed at another role. For example, a topological map is created in response to an interest in the "relief" of the "territory" system (some locality). The map is produced by topographers and used by geodesists, geologists, or geographers and may also be used by designers who are developing a housing project.

A method of description enables the creation of descriptions for any systems. Naturally, one must primarily focus on the target system, but in **project activities or at an enterprise, you will encounter numerous documents describing a vast range of systems** (suprasystems, subsystems, system creation, etc.).

In the table above, you see **the connection between the concepts of role, interest, role description, and method of description**. Notice that you have often encountered such role descriptions in the form of documents. Many of you are familiar with different methods of description by which you create certain documents. Be sure to outline your roles, methods of description, and work products in the appropriate modeling exercise from the course.

Different roles may share an interest, but their role descriptions can vary. One role might have multiple interests. In this case, **a single description can be created that addresses several subjects of interest.**

It is crucial to choose the right methods of description. For instance, different methods are needed for tax, financial, and managerial descriptions. For tax-related descriptions, tax and accounting methods are necessary; for financial descriptions—IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP; and for financial-managerial descriptions, managerial accounting methods come into play. Note that all three descriptions (methods and work products) are created for three different roles—tax specialist, shareholder, and manager.

You clearly understand that **it is impossible to produce qualitative role descriptions if the role method of description and the corresponding documentation are not considered explicitly.** This means they cannot be done unconsciously. Being conscious of applying the method of description significantly increases the likelihood that you will notice the need to learn a new method in a timely manner.
