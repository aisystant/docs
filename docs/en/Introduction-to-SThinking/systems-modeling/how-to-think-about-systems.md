title: How to Think About Systems?
---

**The Goal of This Section** 

The objective of this section is to explore how to think about systems and to understand how systems modeling takes place.

Thinking about systems means modeling them, which involves describing and documenting them. Systems modeling is the process of creating system descriptions that help to understand and explain the complexity and structure within the system, as well as its interaction with the external environment.

Before creating a system, it is essential to formulate its description, more specifically, to produce a **work product with this description, which is** known as **documentation**. Bringing a system to life is considerably more expensive than documenting it, which is why in today's world, there is increased attention on modeling systems as both "black" and "transparent" boxes.

Modeling in systems thinking is the primary means of addressing complexity. Complexity is further compounded by the fact that in a project or an enterprise, you are dealing with multiple systems, each of which requires description as both "black" and "transparent" boxes. **Therefore, you will need to** **create multiple descriptions for various systems and areas of interest**^[In our course and in the second semester of the main program, you will primarily work on a universal approach to modeling any system. In the third semester, you will be involved in describing all systems engaged in the project.]. Descriptions are not only required for the target system but also for the supersystem's areas of interest and the systems being developed. Furthermore, it is often necessary to describe our system and the systems within the creation chains.

All of this would be challenging if it weren't for the **universality of the approach** to such descriptions. In this section, we will explore concepts that enable you to craft systems descriptions while collaborating with a team of systems specialists. To achieve this, we will:

1. Examine approaches to **describing any system** as both "black" and "transparent" boxes;
2. Delve into specific types of descriptions across different areas of interest in **project activities**.
