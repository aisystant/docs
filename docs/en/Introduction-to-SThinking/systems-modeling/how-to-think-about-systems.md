title: How to Think About Systems?
---

**Purpose of This Section** - to understand how to think about systems and how systems modeling occurs.

Thinking about systems means modeling them, that is, describing and documenting them. Systems modeling is the **process of creating** **descriptions** **of a system** that help in understanding and explaining the complexity and structure within the system, as well as its interaction with the external environment.

Before creating a system, it's necessary to produce its description, or more precisely, a **work product with this description**â€”the **System Documentation**. Implementing a system is much more costly than documentation with its description. Therefore, in the modern world, particular attention is paid to modeling the system as both a "black box" and a "transparent box."

Modeling in systems thinking is the main tool to combat complexity. This complexity arises from dealing with multiple systems in a project or organization, each needing to be described as both a "black box" and a "transparent box." **Thus, you will have to create** **multiple descriptions for various systems and subjects of interest**^[In our course and during the second semester of the main program, you will mainly become familiar with a universal approach to modeling any system, while in the third semester, you will work on describing all systems involved in the project.]. This involves not just the target system but also the areas of interest of the supersystem, the system of creation, and often requires describing our system as well as systems in the creation chains.

All of this would be challenging without the **universal approach** to such descriptions. In this section, we will address concepts that will enable you to create systems descriptions while being part of a team of systems specialists. To achieve this:

1. We will explore approaches to **describing any system** as both a "black box" and a "transparent box";
2. We will delve into specific types of descriptions across different subjects of interest in **project activities**.
