title: Examples of System Descriptions as a Transparent Box
---

Let's consider three descriptions using the example of a clock^[Image created by A.Turkhanov.].

**Functional Description** – This describes subsystems as role-based or functional objects. A functional description shows "how the system works internally." For instance, a functional diagram demonstrates how a clock operates. Notice that there are no modules in this diagram because we are focusing on the clock’s functional parts. These parts exhibit their functional or role-based behavior.

**Constructional or Physical Modules** – These are the objects that are assembled to form the clock system. A modular description or breakdown illustrates from what components the system is constructed. As you can see, the modular diagram specifies numerous constructional parts of the system. Although it doesn't clarify how the clock works, it clearly shows how to assemble the clock from gears, springs, hands, and other modules.

The third description pertains to the **spatial arrangement** of the parts of the system. It is essential to know where within the universe the parts of the system are located. This is spatial breakdown. Without knowing the exact placement of the modules, the system won’t function.

**Systems levels are determined by functional breakdown—** the core of systems thinking! Therefore, functional breakdown is often referred to as systemic. But what about the others? These are conventional breakdowns. Naturally, it’s crucial to remember that modular and spatial breakdowns also exist.

As you can see, all systems at each system level interact with each other as functional objects. This interaction is described using a functional diagram. At this system level, it is possible to identify specific physical objects that perform these functions (or act as functional objects). These physical objects are located somewhere in space. If we move to a different system level, everything will be similarly constructed.

For example, we can identify functional and physical objects and their placements at the subsystem level of an engine. Then we can identify functional and physical objects and their placements at the level of the entire automobile. Here, we will not scrutinize the engine structure as it becomes part of the automobile system. We can view the engine system from a functional perspective—this functional object should provide torque^[In cultural terms, a functional object in the engine system is called an engine. Its role is to move. Internal combustion engines move via torque, which is transmitted to the chassis.]. We can also view the engine system as a physical object—it could be a gasoline engine BD-1324. We can ascend another level where there will be other functional and physical objects and their placements.

The next example is related to the **person-actor** system, which can create successful systems in various projects. An actor exhibits functional behavior—life skills. Life skills consist of the following functional components:

* thinking mastery or intellect;
* applied skills.

Another example relates to the functional parts of the automobile system. These would be the chassis, body, and engine. Here, further systemic breakdown can be performed to examine the structure of the chassis and, accordingly, identify the next system level.
