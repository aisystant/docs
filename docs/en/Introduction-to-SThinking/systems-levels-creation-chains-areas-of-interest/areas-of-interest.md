### Section 3: Introduction to the Concept of Subject of Interest

In Section 3, we were introduced to the concept of the **subject of interest**. Various related characteristics or subjects of interest can be grouped into an **area of concern**. These different areas of concern are the focus of specific roles within the project. Since there are quite a few subjects of interest, for convenience, they can be organized into particular areas.

A systems thinker assumes that **each role wants to know** (and predicts) how its preferences will be taken into account. Therefore, roles whose subjects of interest have been prioritized for satisfaction need responses to address these concerns to evaluate the feasibility of their preferences.

Responses to each role's concerns come in the form of **descriptions through documentation (models)**. Models are created only for the subjects of interest and preferences that are selected to be satisfied. However, not every preference is represented by a single model. Typically, models are developed not based on preferences but on subjects or even areas of concern the team decides to address. For instance, to satisfy the concerns of both seller and buyer roles, a "cost estimate" model might be drafted.

Multiple systems are evaluated simultaneously in a project, not just the target system, so there will be numerous models. All these models need to be interconnected. Additionally, a decision on which models to create must be made beforehand. For example, besides the cost estimate for the target system, an expert evaluation or another type of description might be created, and the project's support budget (payroll fund) will be required as a description of the creator-system.

To facilitate the planning, creation, agreement, and modification of models in a project, **areas of concern** are identified, which relate to:

- The three main roles – the areas of concern for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the columns of the Table 3x3.
- The three main systems – the areas of concern for the supersystem, the target system, and the creator. These are the rows of the Table 3x3.

Each area of concern will have its models, subjects of interest for roles, their preferences, and work products. The Table 3x3 draws attention to specific subjects of interest for the primary roles at the subsystem level. It acts as a kind of checklist. Accordingly, in any project, you can list the documents (descriptions, models) that address specific cells in the table.

**The three areas of concern for key roles highlight the need for executors** for all roles stated in Table 3x3, individuals who are skilled in the relevant methods (practices) and capable of producing the necessary work products.

**The three areas of concern for the supersystems address the pertinent questions**^[These questions were discussed earlier in the subsection "Systematism and Systematic Approach".] **within the context of using systems approach:**

1. **Supersystem area of concern:** Why, for whom must something be done, and how will they change their behavior if offered something new? Here, it's essential to hypothesize about which groups of people might improve their lives by using the system you propose, allowing them to assume new roles and/or adopt new methods (including technologies). For example, Henry Ford offered an automobile to all adults, turning them into drivers to solve their mobility problems. Similarly, not everything has to be new; roles and disciplines might remain unchanged, with only a new technology introduced—such as "SAP" for accountants previously using Excel. The main focus in this area of concern includes the group or community of people along with their dissatisfactions, their roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed target system.
   
2. **Target system area of concern:** What is this new thing in terms of product (system), what are its characteristics, and how is it configured or made? Once hypotheses have been made about the supersystem area of concern and the role of the target system is defined, you can move to define the system's architecture, including making architectural decisions. For instance, clocks for a space station, a person, and a tower will differ significantly, not just in materials but also in fundamental operating principles. Here, it will be necessary to perform calculations for the system's total cost of ownership and estimate its price for the buyer.
   
3. **System creation area of concern:** Who and how will create the system, including the methods and resources needed? After hypotheses on the system's configuration are made, we move to the actual creation. It's necessary to determine the methods (practices) through which it will be constructed. Additionally, identifying all creator roles, hiring executors and agents (people, contracting organizations, tools, and AI), and acquiring other resources are needed. Also, economic assessments of the entire undertaking are required.
