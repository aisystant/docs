title: Creation Chain Diagram

Sometimes, you need to logically construct different interconnections to better understand the complexities of human activities. The key is to find your system's and your team's place within the creation chain.

**Various systems** are **strongly connected** through the exploitation stage in the long creation chains. The illustration shows stages of three systems. The run-time stage represents the exploitation phase.

These diagrams are handy for narrating stories like:

* We are a startup poised to evolve into an IT company. The upper line A depicts the stages of creating an IT company.
* The company will develop an IT program for the digital twin of artificial structures, like bridges. Line B depicts the stages of creating an IT program.
* Our IT program will be one of the creation systems involved in designing, constructing, and participating in the exploitation of a bridge. Line C shows the stages of building a bridge.

**It's crucial for us to extend all reasoning to the target systemâ€”the bridge.** We'll have to carefully work through this entire chain, which isn't even fully defined here! There are more creation systems in this example.

If you don't learn to model and document these chains, extending them to the target system every time, you risk engaging in meaningless discussions about your work. However, by mastering systems thinking, you can develop the skill to unravel any complex activity, paying attention to creation chains, systems levels, systems, stages, and the like.

When you model and document the creation chain, you can clearly explain why your project is necessary and how it will lead to the success of the target system. The further you are along the creation chain from the target system, the more focus you must give to it. It's quite distant from you, requiring your thought process to exert effort to keep it in focus. Teams typically "can't see beyond their noses" and don't want to deal with something so removed from their immediate activities. However, this mistake costs not only time and resources but also adds stress, as it hinders clarity and structure in project work.

By using systems thinking, you identify the target system^[Before this, you also need to understand the supersystem, expected behavior of the target system, etc.], and then design (or describe) the entire creation chain up to "your" system^[If it's somewhere in the creation chain, rather than within the target system (as a subsystem).], without skipping any systems in this chain, and maintaining focus on the benefit your project brings to the target system. This approach will bring clarity and organization to your activities: both personal life and work projects.
