title: 'Perform Modeling: 5.2. Annotating with Types Using :: Notation'
---

Text to translate:

Review the example in the first row of the table. Use the most convenient type annotation format in the textâ€”the double colon "::". First, write the name of the object, followed by its type from the meta-model (or additionally from the meta-meta-model). For example: "airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object." If needed, revisit the theoretical material on the :: notation in the course "Efficient Work."

For the sentences from the table, make a duplicate by specifying the types of all objects and relationships as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and write a few examples from work and personal projects.
