title: Creation Chain
---

Another important term related to the three main types of systems is the **creation chain**. This term is more closely associated with the creator or with creation systems.

Let's continue examining the target system of a car. One of the creation systems for it will be an automotive plant. To build this plant, another creation system is required, which would be the automotive plant creation system. This way, we obtain lengthy chains.

In cases of systems like a car or a bridge, such chains are often intuitively understood by many. However, in the case of software, they can be much longer and more complex. This is because software needs to connect to the physical world, meaning it has to find how it relates to a particular target system. Software is rarely created just for the sake of it; it always interfaces with some physical system in the real world.

Consider, for example, any programming projects that abound in the creation of a car. Why do they exist? Why is all this software necessary? Ultimately, to produce a car! Systems thinking requires tracing the entire chain from the IT program used in the creation project to the car itself.
