title: Meta-Systems Transition and Emergence

The multilayered nature of systems partitioning is fundamental. At the very top level of any such partitioning, you might find the universe, and at the very bottom, superstrings^[or other known physical objects at the smallest scale.]. However, the vast majority of people work at intermediate levels, while scientists predominantly focus on the peripheral levels.

For the work we do, a small range of systems levels is keyâ€”one that aligns with our life interests. Although some might work at the level of humanity or at the nanoscale, most will be interested in several systems levels similar to those related to an automobile. For you, this might be an IT program, a bridge, or a particular skill mastery.

**Note: Crossing a systems level changes everything****,** including the names of systems, roles, and so on. Some roles involve using automobiles and discussing who will drive where. Others examine parts of the car and consider how to improve the efficiency of various components. A third group doesn't discuss vehicles at all but simply manufactures standardized parts. Yet another group discusses the materials from which car parts are made. And so forth. This is an intriguing systems thinking technique that helps one understand any complex subject area work.

Each of these roles employs different methods and speaks different languages: some roles' language mainly reflects the environment of the automobile and issues surrounding its use, others focus on the production aspects of car creation and assembly, while others deal with challenges related to material strength, the difficulty of processing, and so forth.

When working with an automobile, terms like "movement, travel," etc., are regularly used, but there is absolutely no mention of the materials from which the car is made. If we shift our attention down one systems level, we begin talking about engine efficiency. And one level further down? Entirely different people engage with the material: strength, friction, and everything else.

This is reflected in the speech of project roles working at each system level. The transition from discussing one system level to another is known as a **meta-systems**** **transition**. For a systems thinker, a meta-systems transition is literally heard in a conversation and visible in the text! One technique of systems thinking is the ability to maintain focus on the systems level being discussed. The reason is that in professional communication, the discussion can touch upon multiple systems levels simultaneously.

The key in communication among experienced specialists is not mere juggling of professional terms, but the fluency of meta-systems transition. **A professional understands the emergent property** at each systems level. For someone with a systems mindset, a discussion is not just a stream of terms; they can literally hear or read concepts from different systems levels and understand the connection between different systems levels and areas of interest.
