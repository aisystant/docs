title: Subject Areas of Interest for the Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Manager
---

Let's delve deeper into the three subject areas of interest and discuss the interests of the three main roles - entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the so-called **functional roles**, which are widely recognized in culture (there are textbooks written about them, and they are comparatively easy to identify) and through which other roles can be explained (they serve as a meta-model for other roles).

For example, if you have a good understanding of medicine and are familiar with many roles within the class of "doctors," an adult might have a decent working overview of medicine. However, if you aim to create successful systems and/or seek career advancement, you also need to understand the roles and work products of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. The functional role of a doctor can also be explained through these three main roles. For instance, the role of a dentist is an engineering role in the project of treating teeth, while the chief physician is a position where a person is likely to perform the role of a manager among other duties.

**The three subject areas of interest** for these roles **represent the minimum work-related (functional) overview of a modern person**. Regardless of your position or the roles you perform, it is essential to have a basic understanding of the subjects of interest to the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager in a specific project or enterprise.

This overview is important for everyone because **we all, to some extent, fulfill the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager**, even in personal projects. Decisions such as where to study or how to invest time, how to develop oneself or a child into an active contributor, and how to manage resources are questions regularly addressed by everyone.

Let's revisit Table 3x3 and consider it through the lens of the three main roles. Notice, for example, that a cook in the project of making borscht acts as a functional role - engineer, but his subjects of interest are not limited to the borscht system, as he may also be interested in serving the dish to diners, kitchen setup, ingredients, utensils, etc. In other words, an engineer is not only interested in the target system but in other aspects as well. Based on this, we can outline common descriptions of subjects of interest, roles, and work products for each cell in the table.

The **entrepreneur** is interested in how to consistently (now and in the future) earn by addressing someone's dissatisfaction. The "entrepreneur" class has interests and corresponding roles such as:

* Promoter (including educator, marketer, salesperson) — an entrepreneur interested in the external environment (market, opportunities) or supersystem, including clientele and their dissatisfaction;
* Visionary (strategist) — an entrepreneur interested in the demand (profitability of sales) of a specific target system now and in the future;
* Businessman (founder) — an entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the target system.

The **engineer** focuses on the target system that's intended to change the world for the better. The "engineer" class has interests and corresponding roles such as:

* Product Owner — an engineer interested in modeling and documenting usage scenarios of the target system as part of the supersystem;
* Target System Engineer — an engineer interested in creating a successful target system (a single instance), taking into account all stakeholders. Roles in the "engineer" class can include architects and developers;
* Development Organizer (DevOps, platform tech developer, method manager) — an engineer interested in the enterprise's functional ability (system creation capability) to produce the target system, also in the required quantity.

The **manager** is concerned with creation systems that need to produce target systems, in the necessary quantity (not just one):

* Manager of External Relations (PR, GR, etc.) — a manager interested in managing external stakeholders' interests regarding the enterprise, including the enterprise's image and communications with various stakeholders, such as investors and the public;
* Operations Manager — a manager responsible for creating and delivering the target system on time and within budget. This role involves organizing existing people to perform the relevant roles in a pre-designed enterprise;
* Administrator — a manager concerned with the operational readiness and capability of all enterprise systems, including qualified personnel, necessary resources (working capital), and functional tools (technologies).

**The team's work logic** can be explained as follows:

1. Initially, the entrepreneur identifies a group of potential clients and their issues (target group). They then determine how to solve these problems and outline a potential target system. They also source resources to organize business activities;
2. Next, the systems engineer^[In roles such as developer, architect, etc.] comes in to identify the project roles' needs and designs the structure of the target system that should solve the problems identified by the entrepreneur;
3. After that, the manager sets up and oversees the enterprise designed to produce the necessary number of target systems to address the target group's problems and informs all external project roles about how their interests are accounted for.

Whatever your role or position, it is advisable to understand the systems' areas of interest and the three main roles' subject areas. You must be adept at thinking about these together and, if necessary, separately, managing your attention accordingly.
