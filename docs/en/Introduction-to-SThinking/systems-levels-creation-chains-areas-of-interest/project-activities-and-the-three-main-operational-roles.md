title: Project Activities and the Three Main Operational Roles
---

In the previous section, we focused on the target system, while the other systems were somewhat auxiliary. However, this does not mean that in project activities, we only create or develop it alone. Practically in **any activity** **or** **project, employees**^[Here, we refer to people as agents or as executors of roles.] **can be part of teams of various** **subprojects** **and be creators of a wide array of systems** (our systems and systems of creation). For instance, Team No. 1 creates a car engine, while another Team No. 2 works on enhancing the skills of Team No. 1 members. Team No. 3 operates on the car assembly line, and Team No. 4 focuses on creating and developing this assembly line. In all four teams, employees of the automotive corporation are involved, and the same person can be a member of several teams.

To understand the project or all teams and their subprojects within an expanded enterprise, we need to:

* use a simplified meta-meta-model "Table 3x3. Areas of Interest" to examine the project for creating the target system, which integrates diverse roles and systems;
* additionally introduce the concepts of "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "system levels."

In the "Table 3x3. Areas of Interest" presented below (hereafter referred to as Table 3x3), **the connection of areas of interest of the three main roles** (subject areas of roles) **and the areas of interest of the three main systems** is shown. This tabular representation is a distinct thinking approach that offers a way to segment the enterprise's (organization's) activities. In systems engineering, another way will be proposed to view the creation and development of systems, along with different role names for cases involving enterprises, clientele, individuals, etc.

In each system area of interest, all main roles are represented â€“ the entrepreneur, the engineer, and the manager. Behind these interests stand the corresponding roles. The rows of Table 3x3 represent the areas of interest of the three main systems, and the columns represent the areas of interest of the three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

Each cell in Table 3x3 represents the **subject of interest** **of a specific role to** **a specific** **system**. That is, the role is interested in not everything within this system but only what pertains directly to it. For example, an entrepreneur interested in the target system and everything connected to it is called a visionary. The same reading applies to all other cells of Table 3x3.
