title: Stages of Immersion in Systems Methodology Using the Example of a "Hammer"
---

Let's explore the progress in learning systems thinking, continuing with our hammer example discussed in previous sections.

In student culture, there are anecdotes about how university students think, highlighting how senior students often know more about life than freshmen. Similarly, in our school, there is a dynamic with the teacher asking a student, "**Give an example of a physical object**." How you answer this question reflects your depth of immersion in systems thinking.

A student in the preparatory course "Systems Self-Development" would answer this question about a physical object with "hammer." And this answer would be accepted. In the preparatory courses at Aisystant, the focus is primarily on **differentiating** the **physical world from the mental space**. This is crucial to separate concepts like "age," "freedom," "love," or "theory" from objects like "hammer," "textbook," or "shorts."

A student in the "Rational Work" course or someone with strong **ontological mastery**^[It’s not necessary to take the "Rational Work" course for this, but it significantly aids the development of ontological thinking, which is essential for systems thinking.] cannot respond like a preparatory program student. They understand that the word "hammer" can refer to an instance of the class "Carpentry Tools." Therefore, it's insufficient to simply say "hammer." The correct response would be: "this large hammer in your hand." This precisely defines the context, making it clear that it's a specific physical object, not an abstract ideal of a class instance.

A student studying systems thinking would go further—they can discuss not just the physical object but also the **system** "hammer." They realize that the word "hammer" can signify different things in different contexts. For instance, it could refer to a class instance, a specific physical object, and a system. In the latter case, the system "hammer" could be "this stone in my hand."

This concept parallels the famous phrase: "The farmer bound the grain with a dull scythe."^[In English, this might sound like "Will Will will Will will Will's will?" Here, too, we have different types: agent, document, and action.] The word "hammer" is singular but can represent very **different types**. Recognizing and discerning these differences is crucial. While this lack of distinction might not attract attention in everyday life, in complex workplace projects, it can hinder success without such skills.

The gradual **immersion in complex methodology** using the hammer example is a common cultural approach to learning. Just like children first learn about numbers, then natural numbers, whole numbers, rational, and real numbers, eventually reaching complex numbers as students^[And some early learning answers may need adjustments following deeper engagement with methodology.], we similarly structure our trajectory in teaching complex systems thinking.

A person studying systems thinking possesses general techniques for thinking about systems, understands different types of systems, and comprehends the distinction between **systems approach 3.0** and previous generations. In subsequent courses of the main program "Organizational Development," you will learn specific principles of working with different types of systems such as individuals, enterprises, IT systems, or automobiles.
