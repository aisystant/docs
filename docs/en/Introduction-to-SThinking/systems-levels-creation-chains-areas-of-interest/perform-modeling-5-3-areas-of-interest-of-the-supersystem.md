title: 'Perform Modeling: 5.3. Areas of Interest of the Supersystem'
---

Please review the example of a project description focused on three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your enterprise or project. Use the practice of thinking through writing, and for the first attempt, write it as best as you can. Afterward, edit to leave only the most essential parts. You can also revisit the description after some time. As the project evolves, remember to update this description as it is helpful for compiling all other descriptions and coordinating team efforts. Create notes for further elaboration as needed. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes" section.

**Locate the relevant task by its number in your modeling workspace and complete all its components.**
