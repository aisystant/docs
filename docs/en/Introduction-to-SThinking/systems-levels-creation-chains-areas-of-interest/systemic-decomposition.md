We have explored areas of interest, and now let's discuss systems decomposition and systems levels. **It’s important not to confuse the concepts of** **“****areas of interest****”** (of systems and roles) **and** **“****systems levels****.”**

As you know, systems can be viewed from different perspectives:

* when a system is a whole made up of various internal parts, meaning the entire system consists of subsystems;
* when a system is itself a part of a larger supersystem, meaning that this system is a subsystem.

Each subsystem is also a whole for its own sub-subsystems, and each supersystem is part of a super-supersystem. Therefore, we can discuss systems decomposition into parts in a top-down or bottom-up manner. If we currently don’t plan to further break down a system, it's referred to as a **“system element,”** highlighting that somewhere there is an overall system for which this subsystem is an element.

The levels in systems decomposition are called **systems levels**. They are distinguished by focusing on the part-whole relationship. Through this relationship, we logically highlight these levels in the physical world. Naturally, there are no special level boundaries in the physical world; it’s the systems thinker who identifies them through observation.

The classic decomposition of systems levels originated from biology. As shown in the diagram, cells consist of molecules, yet cells themselves are part of organs. Organs consist of cells, but organs are parts of organisms, and so on. A person taking on the role of a biologist decided to divide the world into parts in this way and assigned corresponding names to these parts and levels^[Similarly, you'll have to pinpoint names for parts and systems levels in your work projects.].

The diagram shows systems levels – the level of organisms, organs, cells, and molecules. However, it doesn't show the biosphere systems level, which is above the organism level, nor the atomic level, which is below the molecular level. This doesn’t mean they don’t exist; we simply didn’t include them in this diagram.

**Systems levels in your projects are determined as needed**. In most projects, a limited number of systems levels are used, and it's unlikely that you'll consider more than 3–5 levels in your work. Yet, completely disregarding them is impossible since interactions between levels (disarrays) always occur.

Moreover, it’s important to pay attention to other systems on the same systems level. There should be enough focus to track systems in the environment and the physical part-whole relationships several systems levels up and down. Working without focused attention, getting mentally distracted, or confusing what is part and what is whole can be detrimental to the project.

Having established a systems level, we can further discuss areas of interest. For example, in section 4 we highlighted areas of interest for the systems level "car," allowing us to discuss areas of interest for the supersystem (car+driver) and the creator. Similarly, we can highlight areas of interest for the systems level "engine" or "piston." Different teams work on different systems levels and with different areas of interest. When we need to construct a 3x3 Table for a specific system, such as a car, we must understand that the table for a car differs from the table for an engine and a piston, necessitating three different tables.

Note, however, that **systems levels and areas of interest** do not completely overlap each other^[If there's any misunderstanding here, consult your instructor. Without understanding this difference, further study of the textbook will be impossible.]. These are distinct concepts applied to the chosen system. Concerning this target system, areas of interest and systems levels are identified. For example, if we take the "car" system, the area of interest for the supersystem would involve "car+driver"^[Or "car" if creating a 3x3 Table for the "engine" system or "engine" if creating a 3x3 Table for the piston.]. The area of interest for the target system is related to the "car"^[Or correspondingly with "engine," or "piston."]. However, the creator's area of interest does not fit into the systems levels of "supersystem - target system - subsystem."
