title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts
---

Areas of interest consist of several related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas of interest are the focus of attention for all roles in a project. Given the numerous subjects of interest, they are organized into specific areas for ease of management. We identify areas of interest for the supersystem, target system, and creation systems, as well as the subject areas of interest for the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

The levels in the hierarchy of systems decomposition are termed systems levels. At each level, the systems actor sees their roles, methods, systems, concepts, and so on.

Creation chains are systems of creation that plan, create, and dispose of other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the method of distinguishing all the concepts covered in this section. It is one thing to understand them, but applying these concepts to your project might not happen right away. This requires experience in executing several projects.

**Main Concepts:** areas of interest, area of interest of the supersystem, target system, creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, model, activity roles; systems decomposition, systems levels, meta-systems transition, emergence; creation chain; unresolved issues, Systems Approach 3.0, scalelessness, deanthropomorphism, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
