# Systems Thinking: Understanding and Application

There isn't a single precise definition for the concept of "systems thinking," much like it's impossible to provide a comprehensive definition for the concept of "mother." We can say that systems thinking is a type of thinking where the concept of a system and other concepts from the [intellect stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack) are used. Alternatively, systems thinking can be described as thinking in the language of systems [^1]. It is also said that systems thinking facilitates the creation of successful products and services by considering a multitude of interests.

Systems thinking is not supernatural, mystical, or esoteric. We will not delve into the structure of thought at the neuronal level or discuss various psychological aspects. We believe that any form of thinking can be developed through studying certain theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real life. These are the concepts you will learn and apply in your work and personal projects. 

## Why is Systems Thinking Necessary?

Our world is complex and rapidly changing. But what makes it complex, and what exactly is changing so quickly?

The complexity lies in the fact that there are **numerous interests among different people**. Not only do these interests change quickly, but so do knowledge, work methods, work locations, teams, and industries. To create successful products and services, you need to know how to work with modern speeds and complexity. This is where systems thinking comes into play.

For example, when designing a car, you need to consider the interests of the driver, passenger, pedestrian [^2], car owner [^3], automotive corporation [^4], aesthete [^5], environmentalist [^6], and several hundred other roles. Each interest represents a specific worldview or model. Similar interests can be identified in your systems, such as a renovated apartment, a well-raised child ready for adult life, a planted tree, an IT application, a business enterprise, and so on.

In today's world, there's also a need to **quickly adapt to new conditions and learn new things in the shortest time possible**. People need to constantly acquire new skills or professions, understanding unfamiliar fields without stress or delays. 

Mastery of systems thinking allows one to **grasp a new field of activity** within two weeks. In contrast, someone without systems thinking might take years to learn this field. Why is that? A person with systems thinking will focus on the target and other systems (like the supersystem, system creation, etc.), roles, methods, work products, functional and modular parts, system architecture, business architecture, and other focal points present in any field. All these concepts can be found in IT, cooking, or infrastructure (like transportation operations).

Humanity is progressing through **division of labor**. A few centuries ago, there was one roleâ€” "medicus," which dealt with all human ailments. Now, in medicine, there are hundreds (if not thousands) of roles. This division of labor occurs across all fields. No one can master all roles deeply. However, to understand which specialists (and their roles) are needed for your projects, systems thinking is essential. It allows you to "slice" the world into separate, interconnected systems and subsystems.

Established systems thinking helps you not only to quickly integrate into a new world or new projects but also to **manage your focus**, prioritizing what's important at the moment while maintaining a cohesive vision. Our brains may lack the computational power to process every detail of a project. Therefore, the focus must be concentrated in the right "place" and be adaptable. Understanding the placement and connection of these "places" is crucial. By knowing the principles of systems thinking, meeting durations can be reduced from an hour to just 10 minutes [^7].

It's noteworthy that although systems thinking aids in quickly tackling problems across different work areas, it **doesn't replace applied expertise**. However, with systems thinking, you will progress faster in your applied field and become a professional more rapidly. 

Systems thinking enables us to break down complex projects into simpler parts, **link theory and practice**, and work effectively in large teams, organizing our own team efficiently. It also helps us remember all crucial project aspects even amidst chaos, using our memory and specialized modelers [^8].

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, allowing its application to a vast range of complexities, be it inert substances, living beings, cyber-physical systems, individuals, organizations, communities, or even humanity as a whole.

We believe that systems thinking is necessary for anyone in today's world aiming for a career and aspiring to become a development director of a major business. But systems thinking is universal and is equally suited for personal development, nurturing children, and fostering community and societal growth.

## What Does "Systems Thinking" Mean?

In the previous subsection, we discussed that most people operate with a **common understanding of systems thinking**, confusing the concepts of "systematic" and "systematicity."

Sometimes, "systems thinking" is understood as an extraordinary human ability. For example, the ability to combine analysis (understood as deep diving into details) and synthesis (understood as the ability to surface from those details in time). This ability is akin to having a big-picture perspective. It's beneficial to have such an ability just as it's good to be rich and healthy, rather than poor and sick.

Unfortunately, such explanations aren't truly about a "system" or the systems approach. Descriptions about the necessity of diving deep into details and surfacing in time don't offer a way to understand how to master this technique and apply it in daily activities for business people, engineers, managers, or other professionals.

Systems thinking involves human thought that operates using a specific systems language. **Systems thinking involves thinking using the concept of a "system" along with other concepts introduced in certain transdisciplines** from the intellect stack. This includes **conceptualization, ontology, physics, mathematics, and more**. It can also include the application of thinking techniques from the systems approach.

There are numerous variants of the **systems approach** [^9]. Generally, an approach indicates that concepts, thinking methods, and action techniques developed within one discipline (subject area) are applied to other disciplines and subject areas. Our systems approach variant involves applying the concepts, techniques, and methods of transdisciplines from the intellect stack to work and personal areas [^10].

The systems approach is related to methodologies. The emphasis is on the approach as a knowledge transfer. Systems thinking is a human ability (where the key word is "thinking").

**Human thought is an intellectual activity** that results in forming a description of reality. This helps in executing necessary actions, like creating products (systems) and services. For forming such a description, we use words (terms, concepts). If you haven't specifically studied systems thinking, you're likely to use everyday words instead of the concepts from the modern intellect stack.

A layperson differs from a systems professional by their use of systems concepts such as the system, role, method (practice), work product, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergence, and others studied in our course.

Systems thinking requires dedicated study, just as with mathematics, physics, marketing, or management. The first step in this education is to focus on the fundamental concepts and apply them in practice [^11].

Our course also trains thinking techniques. **Thinking techniques involve the ability to relate different concepts to each other and find physical objects in real projects associated with those concepts.** For instance, finding a *target system* and *creator,* identifying the link "role-method (practice)-work product," and dividing the system into *functional* and *modular* parts. This is why we recommend studying the course with mandatory modeling. By applying the concepts and techniques of systems thinking to a work project, **the team saves time and resources in creating a successful system**, improving communication effectively.

During the process, you'll have to **learn to think about three interrelated systems simultaneously**: the "target system," the "supersystem," and the "creation systems." You'll need to cultivate systems thinking at various logical levels. You should identify these systems in your activities, with clients, and with suppliers. You will have to think about the numerous stakeholders of these systems, understanding their interests, roles, and positions, and prepare different descriptions (models) of these systems for them. Importantly, ensure not to confuse *positions* with *roles*.

It's crucial to emphasize that **systems thinking is a specific behavior of the intellect**. The intellect is responsible for solving new problems, things you haven't encountered before. For this, systems thinking concepts and techniques are needed.

A person **thinks using mastered concepts and techniques**, describing the world, work projects, and developed systems with them. This is why systems thinking reproduces the knowledge of the "Systems Thinking" course just as mathematical thinking reproduces the knowledge of the mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks the systems language, forms systems descriptions, and creates successful systems. In systems thinking, a "successful system" is defined as one where all identified project roles' interests, related to that system, have been considered.

Systems thinking brings **universality**, **speed**, and **quality** in solving new complex problems while working with different stakeholders. It manifests in the speed of creating successful systems. To achieve this, it's necessary to work with different interests, considered (addressed) through the formulation of a systems description. Considering different interests in this way allows tackling the most complex tasks facing humanity or individuals, across a wide range of fields.
