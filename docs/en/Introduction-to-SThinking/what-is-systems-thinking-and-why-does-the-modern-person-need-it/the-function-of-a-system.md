title: System Function

Separation of the Physical World and Mental Space helps understand the difference between a **system** and its **function**. For instance, a car is a physical object represented in the real world. It is the embodiment of a system or a physical object that you can touch. Like any system, a car has a function, and in this case, that function is movement. Movement, like any system function, is abstract; you can't touch it. However, we can see movement, or rather, we see a car that is moving.

A **function** (or behavior, or action) is assigned by people; objects don't choose their own functions. A hammer itself cannot designate its function as driving nails. An interested party might take a microscope and assign (call) it a "hammer," meaning assigning it the function of driving nails. In this scenario, the hammer would merely be a role for the microscope. Or for a rock. In such a case, the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role would be to drive nails.

People need not so much the thing itself (the material object) as its function. This is what interested parties value, although the general public rarely shares their views. A systems concept involves separately considering and discussing the **function** that someone needs and the **construction (physical object)** that best executes this function.

The thought practice of separating a system and its function can also be applied to thinking itself. We can say that thinking is a function of the intellect. In this case, the intellect is the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
