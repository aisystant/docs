**Ordinary tasks are addressed using practical expertise, but when the complexity of problems becomes overwhelming, one's intellect or thinking mastery comes into play.**

Modern trends suggest that people are increasingly facing new problems and complex tasks that require balancing a variety of interests. Therefore, the following expectations can be formulated for intelligence that demonstrates a systems concept:

* Interconnection between different worldviews;
* Universality in solving complex problems across different areas of activity;
* Constant improvement in the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory that can tie together different worldviews. For this, there is an **intellect stack of 16 transdisciplines**, and the intelligence loaded with this stack provides the function of systems thinking. This enables systems-oriented individuals to coherently connect the varied interests of stakeholders.

**Main Concepts**: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classical properties of a system: integrity, emergence, nesting; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intellect stack, self-development practices, practical practices; systematicity, using systems approach; practical expertise, thinking mastery, intellect, life mastery.
