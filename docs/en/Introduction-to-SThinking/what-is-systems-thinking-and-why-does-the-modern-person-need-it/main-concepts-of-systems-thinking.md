title: Main Concepts of Systems Thinking
---

Often, people who change their country of residence and immerse themselves in a new language are asked, "What language do you think in now?" Thinking in a particular language means using that language as a tool for organizing thoughts, planning, reasoning, and internal dialogue. Language and thought are closely connected, but this doesn't mean that thinking is entirely dependent on language.

Language serves as a tool that can shape and structure thought processes. This concept is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. It suggests that the language we speak influences our perception of the world and our way of thinking.

Typically, when people mention "language," most immediately think of foreign languages, while few think about professional languages. For instance, the language of a physicist or a mathematician, a swimmer or a driver, an engineer or a manager. It turns out that throughout life, people learn not just Russian or English, but also professional languages. Essentially, learning professional languages is not much different from learning everyday conversational language.

In addition to professional languages, there's a meta-language or systems language. In the systems language, specific words are used to denote particular concepts, which might be named differently in various foreign languages. For example, the fundamental concept of systems thinking can be expressed by the word "система" (in Russian) or "system." Besides the concept of a system (which I'm expressing now in Russian), there are other concepts in systems thinking, such as target system, supersystem, function, architecture, role, method (practice), and so on.

Therefore, one of the shortest answers to the question "What does systems thinking mean?" is "It's when you think using systems approach." Beyond that, one can say that systems thinking helps create successful products and services that account for multiple interests.

Learning systems thinking is essential, like learning any foreign language. It is necessary to study concepts (words) and apply them in your projects and life. It's crucial to immerse yourself in the environment, which is why being part of a community of like-minded people is so important. For instance, this is why Aisystant develops as a community of like-minded individuals, and why we recommend writing your drafts in the Aisystant club. Of course, it's necessary to take this learning seriously and recognize the importance of mastering the systems concept, as it might take years to become fluent.

However, just like with a foreign language, new opportunities appear later. These are even more significant because the systems approach opens doors to any professional languages and to the creation of successful systems in both work and personal life. You can thus more quickly master these professions in any foreign language.

Therefore, study the systems methodology and think using systems approach, not just in everyday Russian or English!

One of the key skills for a modern person is the **ability to learn quickly**. Humans do this much faster than any other animal on earth. Some people learn faster than others, thus making fewer obvious mistakes and living better. To learn quickly, it’s crucial to understand that learning is, first and foremost, the study of theories. And certainly, theories need to be connected with practical activities. The best theories help humanity advance civilization.

Any theory, in turn, consists of certain concepts used to describe the world. It’s essential to pay attention to these when studying theories. You should literally write them down and connect them during course studies and also find their manifestations in the physical world.

In physics, concepts such as physical body, speed, and force are introduced. These concepts are necessary to describe natural phenomena, the structure, and the evolution of the material world. In the discipline of accounting, concepts of asset, liability, double-entry accounting, and others are introduced to describe the enterprise's activities (the balance sheet) for tax accounting purposes. In systems thinking courses, concepts are collected that are necessary for creating a successful system and organizing a large team of specialists from various professions.

**Can you create systems without the concepts of systems thinking?** Of course, you can. But this is like ignoring the laws of physics or trying to learn swimming purely through practice, without understanding the theory of crawl stroke. You'll achieve something, nevertheless. We offer an intellectual language for explaining and changing the world, and in this, we compete with other schools of thought.

With systems thinking concepts, you can not only work faster while increasing the complexity of the systems you create but also apply these concepts to the creation of entirely different systems: IT systems, an airplane, or a house, a nuclear power plant, or a child ready for adult life.

Try to assess your level of mastery with systems thinking concepts yourself. At least think about it to yourself, or better yet, write drafts on each point regarding systems thinking concepts. Here is a list containing most of the concepts studied in Aisystant courses. They are grouped so that you don't just speak about each concept but also explain its distinction from other similar concepts.

1. Systems approach and systematicity
2. Synergy and emergence
3. Physical world and mental space
4. Embeddedness and hierarchy
5. Description, embodiment, and System Documentation
6. Alpha and work product
7. Tasks and methods (practices)
8. Functional analysis and modular synthesis
9. Processes, projects, and tasks
10. Physical object (executor), functional object (role), and function (behavior)
11. Word, object, and system
12. Function and construction
13. Intention, subject of interest, and preference
14. Role, subject of interest, role interest (preference), and description method
15. Discipline and tools
16. Function and service
17. Improvement and development
18. Strategy and strategizing
19. Task management and method (practice) management
20. Black and transparent boxes
21. Architecture and non-architecture
22. Systems of systems and people in systems
23. Systems and traditional leadership
24. Project stages and phases
25. Transdiscipline and discipline, method, and theory
26. Role, performer, rank, and position
27. Role, method (practice), and work product
28. Discontent and subject of interest
29. Entrepreneur, engineer, and manager
30. System levels, value chains, fields of interest
31. Task management: project management, process management, and case management
32. Organizational roles and organizational units
33. System architecture and enterprise architecture
34. Models, meta-models, multimodels, mega-models
35. Modeling and meta-modeling
36. Meta-systems transition and emergence
37. Target system, supersystem, creation system, system in the environment, our system, subsystem
38. Successful system and ethics
39. Subject of interest (concern), description method (viewpoint), description (view).

This exercise is beneficial to carry out during and after completing each Aisystant course. By studying each concept, you will not only be able to speak a common language with entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers but also learn new professional knowledge faster, becoming a sought-after specialist.
