title: Why and What to Learn in the Modern World
---

Every person learns throughout their life, but not everyone realizes this. Not everyone understands what they gain from learning, what exactly they should study, or the role of being a student. Nevertheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills help individuals explore the world, handle uncertainties, solve problems, and achieve goals. Understanding the meaning of life, for instance, is a common answer to the question, "Why learn?"

### The Principle of Optimism by David Deutsch

The **Principle of Optimism by David Deutsch** states that problems will always exist, and only a lack of knowledge prevents us from handling them at any given moment. If we know how to solve certain tasks, they cease to be problems for us. We just need to apply the knowledge we have, which means simply doing it.

We primarily acquire **knowledge** from **theories (disciplines)**, while practice plays a crucial role. As a saying goes, "theory without practice is dead, and practice without theory is blind." When we apply this knowledge in life (using certain tools to do so), we demonstrate mastery. Through mastery, we effect changes (create something new) in the physical world.

For example, someone studies "Accounting," and then, using tools like "1C" or SAP, they demonstrate the mastery of an accountant by creating a **working product**—a balance sheet. Similarly, one can study "Carpentry" and, using carpentry tools, create a working product—a chair. The key is that tangible objects emerge in the world, altering it.

### What to Learn?

The first answer to "What to learn?" is that **you should learn the best theories and master the** **tools** of these disciplines to produce the best working products. It's great if you can find your calling, uncovering what nature has endowed you with. To achieve this, you need to test your hypotheses, which means studying the relevant theory. For instance, if you have a musical talent, music theory is essential. While you can become a professional through practice alone, this path is lengthy, and the likelihood of success is much lower without theory. Talent should ideally be supported by the best theories known to humanity, essentially becoming more cultured.

Without solid theory, it's impossible to progress quickly and consistently, achieving high and stable results.

To study any theory, it is essential to recognize what it entails on a meta-level: **concepts** (terms), **principles** (laws, models), **roles, working products, procedures** (checklists) for creating working products, and **explanations** (proofs, clarifications, justifications). For example, in the discipline of "Accounting," concepts include assets, liabilities, accountant, etc.; roles include accountant, tax officer; principle is double-entry bookkeeping; working products include financial statements, income statements, etc.

In answering "What to learn?" it's useful to categorize knowledge (theories, disciplines) into:

1. **Thinking mastery**—helping to tackle new and previously unknown problems.
2. **Applied mastery**—addressing a specific class of tasks.

### Developing Thinking and Applied Mastery

In today's world, it's crucial to continuously develop thinking mastery (intellect) and, when necessary, enhance specific applied mastery (professional skills and abilities). Thus, everyone is both an **intellectual and a professional**, continually tackling new problems through their intellect and solving specific known tasks professionally.

Even when a child learns to walk, they're employing their intellect; as they master this skill, they gain applied mastery. The process of developing simple applied skills involves intelligence, initially based on innate reflexes and genetics. It continually evolves as one encounters new experiences. For example, a child going to the store for the first time, moving to another city for school, or tackling new work challenges develops their intellect, often unconsciously.

Formal thinking techniques and approaches would be helpful when first creating a car or IT program. Yet, nature hasn’t equipped us with them. These methods can be learned, and currently, the best thinking techniques are compiled in **systems thinking**.

### The Role of Systems Thinking and Applied Disciplines

Applied disciplines (knowledge) deal with specific physical systems identifiable on different levels or scales. For instance, a therapist works on the entire body, while a neurobiologist works at the cellular level. Professionalism involves quickly and effectively solving a familiar class of tasks. A professional swimmer might cover a certain distance, whereas a professional manager knows how to run a company. To become a professional, one must learn a specific applied method—like a swimmer mastering the crawl stroke or a manager learning project management. It is professionalism, rather than sheer intellect, that's financially rewarding, yielding good earnings and recognition. Intellect accelerates professionalization, especially important when creating complex systems or adapting frequently, working in large teams.

Since we learn throughout our lives, **conscious learning is invaluable**. Therefore, at a fundamental level, everyone must understand the importance of learning, the structure of any theory, how to choose the best knowledge, and learn it rapidly.
