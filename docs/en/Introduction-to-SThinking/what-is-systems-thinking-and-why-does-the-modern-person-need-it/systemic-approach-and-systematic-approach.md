title: System Approach and Systematicness
---

Most people operate with a **"colloquial" understanding of the concepts of "system" and "systems thinking."** They often equate "using systems approach" with personal organization, diligence, and a desire to foresee everything, considering all possible details and overall importance. This understanding is incorrect!

**"Using systems approach" is often confused with "systematicness,"** and systemically poor or incorrect thinking can lead to unfortunate outcomes. Although many dictionaries define using systems approach and systematicness as synonyms, we will separate these concepts. **Systematicness, regularity, discipline** mean a person does something constantly, by schedule, whereas **using systems approach** means a person can "slice" the world into different systems with their attention and work with these systems and the varied interests of people. This is a separate way of thinking (systems thinking mastery) that requires systematic training.

Using systems approach determines "what to do," while systematicness indicates that it should be done regularly and rhythmically. One concept does not replace the other. **It is essential to be both using systems approach and systematic.** This course discusses systems thinking mastery, while systematicness is covered in the "Practices of Self-Development" course.

It's widely known that everything in the world is interconnected, but using systems approach is not only about ensuring no detail is missed. One must **distinguish what is important from the general background** and, conversely, integrate something important into the overall context. Systems thinking guides a specialist's or team's attention during project implementation. Attention targets are labeled with specific concepts^[At the beginning of the previous subsection, concepts were introduced: roles, methods, work products, systems, architecture, etc. In this course, we will study several dozen systems concepts.]. Using these concepts, we highlight important aspects and contexts with our attention. Therefore, our course:

* introduces several dozen such **systems concepts**;
* teaches **thinking mastery techniques** and the corresponding systematic modeling that links these concepts;
* develops the skill of **locating these concepts** **in work and personal** projects.

Let's present two techniques of systems thinking that will be explored in the course.

The first technique focuses on the idea that **any activity can be viewed through three interrelated areas.** They should answer the following questions:

1. Why, for whom, and what needs to be done and how they will change their behavior if offered something new?
2. What is this new entity from a product (system) perspective, what are its characteristics, how is it structured, and from what is it created?
3. Who and how will create the system, including by what methods and with what resources?

The second technique involves the **connection between analysis and synthesis or highlighting the functions and constructions of the system.** In corporate culture, much emphasis is placed on analysis. This is certainly correct. But one mustn't forget that analytical activity is only a part, synthesis is also necessary. Analysis is the breakdown into parts, whereas synthesis is the assembly and creation of a working product (system). Systems thinking uses both functional analysis, which involves dividing a system into functional parts, and modular synthesis, which involves assembling an entire system from constructive parts. It's the working product or physical construction that introduces novelty and changes behavior (changes the world), and it's this for which people pay.

Considering the above, you should be ready for many of your current perceptions to **contradict** the methodology of systems thinking. By addressing these inconsistencies through thinking through writing (modeling), by the end of the course, your worldview will significantly evolve.
