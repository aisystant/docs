title: 'Perform Modeling: 1.6. Classical Properties of a System'
---

Text to translate:

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material. Note that the "System" column presents examples of ideal objects. Recall the differences between the classical systems concept and the systems concept 2.0, specifically, what objective and subjective system consideration means.

Describe the properties of the systems listed in the table. Feel free to come up with your own examples. Highlight classic properties of systems from your work and personal projects.

Form notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, write down reflections or questions that you can later bring up in support chats.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
