title: Complexity

System thinking deals with complexity. **Complexity** is a concept that has multiple meanings in different contexts and theories. We will discuss complexity in the following contexts:

* When we encounter something **new and unknown**, it is inherently complex, as we do not have ready-made methods to address it;
* When a **complex system is created or exists**, such as one consisting of a large number of interconnected elements. Examples include a "Company with 1000 employees" or an "Electric vehicle";
* When the system involves a **large number of stakeholders** who are influenced by the system or influence the system themselves. Such systems are likely to be complex, but we highlight this third type of complexity to emphasize the numerous interests in the system that must be taken into account to create a successful system.

System thinking helps continuously increase the level of complexity you can handle throughout your life. Apart from the ability to work with complexity, a system practitioner also enhances work speed. But first, you need to **acquire fluency (speed) in applying system thinking.** To achieve this, it's necessary to gradually tackle increasingly complex types of systems:

1. Start with simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer";
2. Then address your body and personal mastery;
3. Next, move to IT systems (cyber-physical systems) where software is seen as a personality, and "mastery" is one of the application programs^[If you're not an IT specialist, comparing these to a personality will help you understand IT better. The human body can be viewed as IT hardware, while specific mastery (as part of personality) is the software.];
4. After that, progress to teams and enterprises;
5. Finally, reach higher system levels - community, society, humanity...

We do not recommend immediately applying system thinking to your most complex project. Doing so may lead to confusion and time loss. Start with the simplest project, and once you achieve fluency, move on to more complex systems.

In our course, we focus largely on simple systems. In the courses "System Thinking," "Methodology," and "Systems Engineering," you will solidify this understanding and recognize similarities with other systems. Upon completing the "Engineering of Personality" course, you’ll understand personality, and after successfully finishing the "System Management" course, you might become a **Director of Development** in an enterprise. Courses addressing higher system levels are currently in development.

This step-by-step approach develops the **capability to constantly** **increase** **the complexity threshold and speed.** Of course, everyone wants everything immediately, but that rarely happens in life. Training systematicity together with using systems approach will be your competitive advantage and ensure that life is never boring. A system thinker with **agency**^[Agency — the ability to set goals and act to improve their current state. An agent actively influences both themselves and the world around them. Agency is comparable to being driven by an insatiable urge.] will always possess the motivated desire and ability to do something cool and necessary for people, raising complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of endless development and personal self-development.
