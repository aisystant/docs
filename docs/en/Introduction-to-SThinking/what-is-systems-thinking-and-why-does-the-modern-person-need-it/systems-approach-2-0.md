title: System Approach 2.0
---

In the classic systems approach, systems were viewed as material objects possessing three properties: **wholeness**, **emergence**, and **embeddedness**^[Do not confuse "embeddedness" with "hierarchical structure." The latter may appear in descriptions of first-generation system properties, but this is incorrect. Hierarchical structure is a broader principle than embeddedness. Embeddedness is a specific case of hierarchy, meaning not every hierarchy implies embeddedness. For example, a boss and subordinate relationship is hierarchical but not embedded.]. However, these systems were considered ideal physical objects, entirely disassociated from human interests. The connection to human interests emerged in the so-called Systems Approach 2.0, which is based on entirely different systems methodologies compared to the first generation^[In both the first and second generations of the systems approach, diverse systems methodologies exist. Each has its own set of concepts and thinking techniques. Their common distinguishing feature is that beyond the concept of "system," each includes the concept of "role," or "stakeholder," or "interested parties." One such second-generation systemic methodology is the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).].

Systems Approach 2.0 does not reject the classic properties of a system introduced in the first generation. These are all necessary conditions for the system's existence but are no longer sufficient. In modern interpretation, the term "system" acquires new additional properties stemming from a **subjective perspective** on the system.

As mentioned earlier, the classic approach is more abstract and views ideal objects, whereas the **second-generation systems approach is pragmatic**, dealing with objects necessary or affecting certain people for specific reasons.

Systems Approach 2.0 is not used when the conversation is simply about a table, a clock, or a car without a real project context. These are more like ideal objects of mental space, often not representing specific physical objects needed by specific people in specific projects.

Systems thinking arises when we talk about systems like "office desk," "wristwatch," or "passenger car." In this context, at least interests and stakeholder roles can be discussed, which have expectations from these systems. Based on this, the system, its boundaries, and how it will be used are defined.

In Systems Approach 2.0, all project roles influencing the system or individuals in specific roles affected by it are considered stakeholders. The combination of all project roles' interests determines what the system will be like, its function, what it will consist of, etc.

The thinking technique consists of the principle that "**No interests – no system**." For instance, an automotive corporation creates a passenger car taking into account potential customers' interests in roles like driver, passenger, user, owner, pedestrians, regulatory bodies, environmental advocates, etc. Whether it is a passenger or cargo vehicle, what type of engine it will have, or its load capacity depends on the interests of the stakeholders.

Every considered interest dictates the requirements for the car. If there were no environmental interests, there would be no need to integrate an exhaust gas cleaning subsystem that meets Euro-6 standards. By including such a subsystem in the vehicle, the manufacturer alters the system design.

Everything installed in a passenger car **is a response to a project role's interest** that the car manufacturer decided to accommodate. The "passenger car" system will be successful if the interests of all stakeholders (project roles) are addressed (satisfied).

**Let’s now discuss a systems thinking technique: first, an **outward** view, and only then **inward** into the system.**

The system's interaction and project roles influence its boundary (wholeness), function, and structure. Therefore, **the discussion of a system begins not with its internal structure but with an understanding of its** **environment**. That is, which supersystem the system belongs to, who needs it, what these stakeholders require, and what issues and interests they have regarding the system. This leads to a vital system principle: always start by looking outside the system, and only then look inside.

For example, in the classical examination of the "clock" system, one might start by understanding the system's properties, focusing internally, i.e., discussing its components. However, in modern examination, it's essential **to start by looking outside the system**, considering what larger system the clock is a part of, who needs it, and how it's used.

Such examination clarifies whether we refer to a wristwatch, a cuckoo clock, or a tower clock. Each of these clocks has a different design. Without listing and understanding the interests of interested parties, one cannot discuss the system's structure.

Thus, in Systems Approach 2.0, systems not only possess the properties of wholeness, emergence, and embeddedness, but an essential property is that **systems depend on stakeholders** (project roles). The system's success depends on satisfying the interests of project roles, so consideration starts with the environment: look outward first, then inward into the system.
