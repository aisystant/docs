**Translate the following text:**

Write down the five or more concepts from this section that you remember the most, and next to each, note the concepts they are most strongly connected with for you. These other concepts can come from your current worldview, meaning it's not necessary to only use the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with classmates, colleagues, or loved ones. For instance, you might try to explain these concepts in simple terms, provide examples from your own experience, relate different concepts to each other, or explain their significance.

**Find the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.**
