title: 'Perform the Modeling: 3.5. Roles Executed by the Manager'
---

**Translation:**

Please review the example in the first row of the table. Write down for your manager at least three roles you know they have performed in the past few months, arranging them by the time they were carried out if possible. Don’t forget roles like "strategist," "leader," "organizer," and other managerial and entrepreneurial roles, as well as roles undertaken by organizational engineers (technical engineers, unlike enterprise engineers, often don’t consider this actual work, but it is indeed work—it requires skill, significant time investment, and other resources). If you're lacking the insight to find the right words and labels (names), feel free to use ChatGPT or Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts you know.

List the roles you perform as a manager in a professional or personal project. If you believe you aren't a manager anywhere, that's an obvious mistake. If needed, use thinking through writing to consider this question.
