title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations'
---

Please review the example in the first row of the table. Notice that a well-formulated description of an action suggests a role. Some roles are culturally conditioned, meaning they are widely used. Try to identify them by using ChatGPT or Google, or by consulting acquaintances who are experts. Interview three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not desk work; you'll need to communicate with various people a lot! Don't delay this for the future, start today. For example, write, call, or chat with colleagues over a cup of coffee. Avoid recording information about colleagues that you already know!

Afterward, fill in the row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Start describing your activities in any way, and then refine it. Prepare a draft about this in the Aisystant blog.
