## Translation

In the previous section, we briefly discussed the distinction between **physical objects, functional objects, and functional (or role-based) behavior**. For example, a physical object could be a microscope^[Although when we say "microscope," we primarily mean the role of "microscope." But we also call the physical item, which is commonly referred to as a microscope. It's only through the context of discussions that one can understand this difference. It's great if you grasp this duality, as with a hammer. A systems-oriented individual comprehends this distinction well. It's best to start with a stone.] or a rock. These objects can assume different roles and perform various functions that someone assigns to them. In our example, the functional object or role is as a "nail driver." In culture, this role is customarily called a "hammer." Meanwhile, the function or functional or role-based behavior is driving nails.

As discussed earlier, each role has a culturally-conditioned^[Or conditioned by cultural norms and rules, i.e., accepted in culture, norms of behavior, usage, etc.] behavior and a corresponding culturally rooted name. Everyone understands what the role of a "hammer" is and its behavior of driving nails. The physical item that can become a hammer^[Meaning play the role of a hammer. Note that the same reasoning applies if we were discussing a manager role that John Doe or Jane Doe could play.] can vary.

This approach of thinking, where items are named according to their primary function^[Or by their role-based behavior.], allows for significant conservation of cognitive resources. We **first consider** **the actions (behavior and other activities), and then identify physical** **objects capable of performing these actions**. Cultural conditioning aids in faster agreements^[Although not all established names of items adhere to this principle. Sometimes ancient names have unclear origins and often point to form or something else rather than a role/function. As a general etiquette, when developing a system, it's correct to seek a name that indicates a role — and, consequently, the function or actions associated with that role.]: there's no need to repeatedly refer to a functional object as "a person who drives a car." Instead, we quickly and succinctly designate this as the role — driver^[Similarly, it was previously suggested not to refer to a functional object as "nail driver," but to use the role name "hammer."]. 

Below is a brief excerpt from the textbook "Systems Thinking":

"Systems are primarily regarded as functional (role-based) objects at the moment when they perform their function, meaning they are operational and functional. At this point, they provide value to those who require the given function. For example, an airplane as a system is primarily a role-based or functional object that flies itself, simultaneously transporting passengers and cargo through the air. The most common function of an airplane is to facilitate flight, which is reflected in its system name, airplane.

The primary purpose of a pump is to pump. That's why this product name has culturally evolved. Manufacturers aim to please customers, hence they name their products so that customers quickly understand the value. Clients consciously (or intuitively) recognize the desired function and get acquainted with manufacturers' products starting with their functional names^[Products may also have other names. For example, names. Airplanes carry the names of great individuals.]. Nevertheless, a system named by the manufacturer as "Pump NV-23"^[Here, we refer to a physical object - "Pump NV-23" that can perform the function of pumping and play the role of a pump.] might carry out a different function for the client. For instance, it might compress antifreeze. Thus, in this scenario, the client's request for a function has shifted, they need a functional object — an antifreeze compressor. Will the "Pump NV-23" suit the role of "antifreeze compressor"? Possibly yes.

Hence, a pump might be named "antifreeze compressor in the second cooling loop" if its designated role is to pump antifreeze in the second loop. The factory will sell the physical object "Pump NV-23"^[This product was intended to fulfill the role of a pump, i.e., to perform the function of pumping.], but the buyer may use it for another role (compressor). This happens frequently. Without the context of use, it's "just a pump," meaning a structural object sans surroundings. In the context of role play — it's a role-based object, "antifreeze compressor in the second cooling loop." Outside the context of using engineering skills, Masha is just Masha; she can be many things. Similarly, a microscope: it can show small objects, be used to crack nuts, drive nails, or serve as a paperweight. Just like Masha — she can do a lot. But when performing the function of an engineer, engaging in role-based behavior, Masha will be called "engineer." This is normal.

Therefore, **it's crucial to name systems by their primary purpose**^[Note that in established item names, this rule may not always be followed, but in your projects, you'll save a lot of time if you do adhere to it. You'll be able to reach agreements quicker and understand client requests and your product more clearly. For more on system naming, refer to Section 5 of the online course "Systems Thinking".]**, specifically by their assigned roles**. These roles define the function. Sometimes, the function is clear, but naming the role right away can be challenging^[A quick understanding emerges that a "nail driving" function is needed, and hence the role is a nail driver. But to name the role "hammer" requires a strong activity perspective. While the concept of a hammer is generally understood, try naming project roles at an aircraft factory or the subsystems of an airplane.]. Having a broad perspective is essential for easily identifying role names.

When we name a system "microscope," we primarily mean that it allows "viewing small objects" when it is fully constructed and operational. If we thought we would be driving nails with this object, we would say that this physical object "Microscope MP-2" will play the role of a "hammer" and perform the function of driving or hammering.

Moreover, if someone declares a person as a system, not much can immediately be said about their function in the environment. A person is a multifunctional object capable of numerous actions, while they can be viewed as a biological body from a medical perspective, for instance. We discussed in the previous section that a person can play a variety of roles. Therefore, role-based behavior or human functions must always be investigated separately and specifically. However, **thought** **about** **people** **in roles and about a microscope-as-role are structured the same way**!^[Systems thinking begins with viewing systems as role-based (functional) objects that exercise certain behavior in an environment. First, we look at the performed or required function, assigned role, or purpose. Then, we analyze the construction or physical object that will play the determined role.]

If you struggle to understand these concepts and the importance of such distinctions for project activities, this indicates gaps in your understanding of ontology. To master systems thinking, one must have in mind a **type classifier**^[Remember, this is the ability to track the types of applied concepts, not confusing, for example, role and executor, system and process, function and structure, etc.]. If you face difficulties with this, we recommend enrolling in the "Rational Work" course.
