---

Text to translate:

Review the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material on the differences between “subject of interest,” “preference,” and “intention.” Which of these concepts relate to a role, and which to an executor/performer of the role? Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Keep in mind that a project role may be external or internal in relation to the system.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. It's sufficient to give one example in each cell.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.**
