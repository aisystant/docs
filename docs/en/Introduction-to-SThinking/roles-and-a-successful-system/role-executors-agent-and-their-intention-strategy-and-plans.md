title: 'Role Performers: Agent and Their Intention, Strategy, and Plans'
---

Handling roles requires attention to the role's executor, who acts as an agent. An agent is a person or another entity (such as an organization, team, or soon, AI) that intends to perform actions to resolve dissatisfaction. The term "person" is too broad^[For example, when discussing a person, one could also consider the organism and its structure. However, we won't delve into that, so the term "agent" allows us to narrow down the broad concept of "person."]. We need to focus on the dissatisfactions and desires that drive a person's actions.

When it comes to individuals, there is a risk of getting lost in psychological terminology, which is less formal and unsuitable for systems modeling. Therefore, to discuss a human-agent, we introduce the concept of "intention"^[Do not confuse: intention relates to the human-agent or executor, while preference relates to the role. Thus, it's appropriate to say: "the person intends to take action" and "the person in the role has a role interest" or "the role has a role interest." It's incorrect, from the perspective of systems thinking, to say: "the role has an intention" or "the person pursues a role interest."]. Intention allows us to discuss not the role itself, but its executor. In this context, "preference" pertains to the role, whereas "intention" refers to the role's executor.

In the textbook "Systems Self-Development," a scheme for linking psychology and systems thinking was introduced. Here, we'll refine it a bit. When feeling dissatisfaction, a human-agent intends to assume a role, acting upon a method to eliminate this dissatisfaction. Simultaneously, the agent in the role employs this method in the creation of a certain system.

The agent acts according to the role, thereby pursuing a role interest (preference) in the system. However, the agent may intentionally switch between roles, leading to a shift in preferences. For instance, we might expect a person to play a certain role and pursue the associated role interests, but they might end up switching roles, following a different role interest, possibly even related to an entirely different system. To address the agent's intentions, specific practices are required^[This essentially involves creating a system meant to fulfill a particular role. But this system isn't composed of metal, plastic, and other materials; rather, it's made "of flesh and blood." While an inanimate system is created using purely engineering methods, this isn't sufficient for a biological system. Working at the organism's part level may require medical professionals, at the genetic level—neurobiologists, and at the whole organism level—trainers (e.g., teaching swimming), educators (teaching professional methods), and systems leaders (helping assume the correct roles).], primarily systems leadership. Systems leadership is a method of positioning the executor-agent in a project role. Physical inanimate objects are positioned in roles using standard engineering approaches^[For example, mechanical engineering "places" a specific "Engine M-1245" in the role of a motor for a car.], whereas for agents, systems leadership replaces these methods.

The concept of "intention" is essential, primarily to identify specific people who are connected to your system and project. For these specific individuals, project roles need to be identified, or conversely, project roles need to be linked to specific people.

It often happens that you are surrounded by a large number of people, yet you can't discern their intentions and, consequently, do not understand if they are stakeholders^[A person might play a different role during the discussion, one that doesn't pertain to your project. At that moment, the human actor's intention is to play a different role than you expect, a completely different one. In this instance, you don't have a vested role, or rather, there is no actor in that role. This is where systems leadership is necessary if you wish to change the human actor's intention.]. Sometimes, the situation is the opposite, with no one around you or you're working in a small team, yet there are people somewhere who want something from you or your project. By identifying these people's intentions, you can better understand if they are stakeholders and what specific roles they play concerning your system.

Thus, when working with project roles, it's crucial to know all executors and their intentions. If the executors' intentions aren't connected to your project's roles, you have either chosen the wrong executors, or you'll need to change their intentions.
