title: Subject of Interest, Role Interest, or Preference
---

Let's take a closer look at the concepts of "subject of interest" and "role interest" (preference). It's important to remember that when we talk about a project role (with an executor being an agent), we inherently imply that this role has a specific subject of interest in the system, meaning it finds something pertinent in it. Ultimately, thinking mastery values not roles themselves but the characteristics of the system which are essential to roles. It is through roles and their methods that we can access the system's characteristics. We can say that a role is concerned with certain important interests of the system.

The subject of interest refers to an important characteristic of a system, and it's crucial for us to employ this thinking strategy to distinguish "system" from "subjects of interest" in discussions. For instance, an automotive system can be characterized by factors like cost, speed, color, design, and many others. According to the international standard ISO 42010, an approximate list of subjects of interest includes functionality, reachability, usage, purpose of the system, systems capabilities, systems properties, known constraints, structure, behavior, effectiveness/performance, resource usage, reliability, protection, information integrity and security, complexity, ability to evolve, openness, parallelism in execution, autonomy, cost, schedule, service quality, flexibility in use, development flexibility, modification capability, modularity, management, inter-process communication, deadlocks, state changes, subsystem integration, data availability, privacy, legal compliance, justifications, organizational objectives and strategies, user experience, maintainability, cost acceptability, and ease of decommissioning and disposal. As you can imagine, this list is not exhaustive as different systems may have additional characteristics (subjects of interest).

The cost of a vehicle concerns the buyer, thus making its subject of interest the price (or cost). Note that the subject of interest in a system belongs to the role, not the executor of the role. John Doe or Andrew Smith, in the role of a buyer, share the same subject of interest regarding the price of a car.

It's crucial not to confuse subjects of interest with the system's functions. The functions of different systems can be unique, while subjects of interest often remain common across many systems. For example, the functions of a chair and a table differ, yet the subjects of interest in these systems might be similar: cost, size, stability, reliability, and so on.

Additionally, identifying and implementing important system characteristics are independent subjects of interest for the role of an architect. In other words, a system architect needs these system characteristics to perform their work. For example, the architect is concerned with subjects of interest like reliability, safety, resilience, scalability, availability, continuity, performance, configurability, extensibility, reusability, localization, maintainability, portability, and upgrade capability.

The architect works with these subjects of interest (highlighting the most important ones), which are known as architectural characteristics, resulting in a constructive solution or a proposal for dividing the system into specific modules. You don't have to know architectural methods or work as an architect, but you should understand the essence of architectural work from a systems perspective: what the architect does and their work product. Similarly, you might not perform plumbing work in your apartment, but you're well-informed about the plumber's work, and you can even assign them tasks and evaluate their work.

Many different roles may share the same subject of interest. However, role interest for these roles can differ. Therefore, another term is introducedâ€”preference. It indicates what a specific role wants in terms of the subjects of interest. Price concerns not only the buyer but also the seller, yet their preferences or role interests differ. The subject of interest remains the same, but the buyer prefers a lower price, while the seller prefers a higher one. Thus, roles have different preferences (or role interests) with the same subject of interest.

When identifying a project role, you simultaneously imply that there are specific subjects of interests. Project role names in culture are tied to system-related subjects of interest. A manager's subject of interest in the "enterprise" system involves timelines, finances, budget, etc. This means the manager isn't interested in the entire enterprise, only certain characteristics. Other roles are concerned with different system characteristics.

It's important to note that understanding subjects of interest and role names is part of general knowledge. Most people have a good understanding of medical roles. Some are more familiar with medicine than entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. You know there are many types of doctors, and you even understand their subjects of interest. For example, you can distinguish between a therapist and a pediatrician, and you know what concerns an otolaryngologist and a dentist. However, you're unlikely to name three roles in the "engineers" or "managers" categories unless you have a special interest in them. Therefore, after studying systems thinking, it's crucial to explore systems management and systems engineering.

To be successful, one must understand roles and interests in project activities far better than any particular area. Our educational program aims to establish a general knowledge base.
