title: Project Roles, Their Methods, and Work Products

### Translation

The term "role" is used more frequently in professional activities than in personal life^[However, all considerations are applicable to personal projects.]. In a work context, we're primarily discussing project activities, hence the term **project role** is utilized. A project role is a role executed by an agent (a person or any other intentional agent) within a project^[If the executor is an inanimate object, we will not use the term "project role"; we will simply refer to it as a "role."]. Alternatively, it can be performed by an agent who somehow influences or is linked to the system being developed within the project. One could say that project roles are concerned with specific elements. They have a particular subject of interest in the system.

In systems thinking, **external and internal project roles** are distinguished. 

**Internal or team project roles** refer to roles fulfilled by members of the project team and all co-executors^[Project team members and co-executors are also considered agents.]. Each role employs corresponding methods and produces certain work products. For instance, suppliers who provide components engage in the practice of supply, resulting in components appearing in the warehouse. All internal project roles are part of an extended enterprise, meaning these roles conceive, create, and maintain system operation — repair, service, and also dispose of it.

Regarding the automobile system, internal project roles include the factory manager, design engineer, assembly line worker, service station specialist, marketers, repair specialists, designers, testers, component suppliers, liquidators, etc. They all follow specific methods (practices) and create their own work products. These role performers are part of the large team working with the automobile system at all stages — from conception to liquidation.

**External project roles** are those that interact with the finished system. These roles may be part of a supersystem, an ultra-system, or the environment, meaning they either impact the system or are impacted by it. They too practice methods, and have their own work products^[It's not recommended to generally call them “clients” or “users”; it's better to refer to their specific roles, as they call themselves, which also clarifies their methods. For example, when selling cars, the external role should be “driver” or “owner,” rather than just “client.”]. For the automobile system, external project roles might be the driver, passenger, pedestrian, environmentalist, and many others. Additionally, you could identify roles such as customer, competitor, tax collector, hacker, thief, etc. Clients of a system should be divided into roles specific to each system and/or field of activity. For instance, a client^[For any system, you can identify the client, so to describe their actions more precisely, it's necessary to define the role more clearly. Merely mentioning the general term "client" for all systems is insufficient. Behind the “client” lie many specific roles that must be considered when working with the system.] could be a payer, operator, unpacker, etc. Try to identify the methods and work products of these roles.

A person^[Do not confuse the description, the role of the driver, with the user persona often used in marketing. The latter describes the executor of a role (a person).] in a project role makes decisions accordingly and is accountable for them. Or, as the saying goes, they put their "skin in the game." The consequences of these decisions result in changes to project activities, meaning how the **project role changes the world**^[More about this is written in the section "Roles of Analysts and Engineers: Positions" of the "Systems Thinking" textbook.].

Human actions **that do not lead to changes in the physical world** are not considered project role actions. You cannot say a person plays a role if they do not create formal work products for which they are accountable (for instance, by signing off on it or otherwise putting their skin in the game). If a person fully executes a practice resulting in a work product, such as a financial statement endorsed with their signature, then one can say the person plays the role of an accountant. The emergence of a work product approved by a project role changes the physical world in some way^[At the very least, taxes will be paid.].
