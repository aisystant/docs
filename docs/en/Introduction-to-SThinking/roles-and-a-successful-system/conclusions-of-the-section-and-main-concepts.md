Using the concept of "role," humanity better describes the physical world and models human activity. A "role" is associated with action, and an agent is the executor/performer of a role. Furthermore, one can separately discuss the mastery and qualifications of the executor/performer, as well as the role-specific actions necessary within a team.

It can be said that a "role" is a model of thinking that helps to study and improve an agent's behavior. Successful systems are determined by the concepts of "role," "subject of interest," and "role interests" (preferences).

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions, regardless of who currently performs the role. We refer to this knowledge, along with the tools, as a method (practice). Using specific methods (practices), roles create work products.
