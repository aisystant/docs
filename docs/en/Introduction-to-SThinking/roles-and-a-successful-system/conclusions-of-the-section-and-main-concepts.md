title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

To describe the physical world and model human activities more effectively, humanity uses the concept of "role." A "role" is linked to action, and the agent is the executor or performer of the role. Separately, one can discuss the skills and qualifications of the executor, and also independently address and improve the role-specific actions necessary in a team.

It can be said that a "role" is a thinking model that aids in studying and improving an agent's behavior. Concepts like "role," "subject of interest," and "role interests" (or preferences) determine a successful system.

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions regardless of who currently performs the role. This knowledge, coupled with tools, is what we term a method (or practice). Through certain methods (practices), roles produce work products.
