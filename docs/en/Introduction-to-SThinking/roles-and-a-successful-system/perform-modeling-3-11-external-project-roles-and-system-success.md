title: 'Perform Modelling: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success'
---

Please list at least 15 external roles of different people involved in your current project and their interests. Remember, a single person can assume multiple roles, so try to list all the roles a person fulfills. Rate your expectation (on a scale from 1 to 10) for how well their preferences will be met upon project completion. If necessary, make notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you might write down a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its aspects.**
