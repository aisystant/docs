Translate the following text to en:

List at least 15 external roles of different people involved in your current project and their interests. Remember that one person can play multiple roles, so try to list all the roles for each individual. Assign your expectation (on a scale from one to ten) regarding how well their preferences will be met by the end of the project. If necessary, create notes for future development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you might jot down a question to ask the support chat or a thought for a future draft.
