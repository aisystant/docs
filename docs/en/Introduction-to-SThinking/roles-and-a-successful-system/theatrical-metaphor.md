title: Theatrical Metaphor
---

To understand what a "role" is, let's turn to theater. Everyone knows the phrase, "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." This phrase holds philosophical significance and is also useful in systems thinking.

The theatrical metaphor helps explain the difference between action and the performer of the action, or between **a role and the performer of the role**^[However, it's important not to think of 'self' as just a collection of roles. The 'self' is the performer of a specific role in a particular situation or project, though one may possess the mastery to play various roles.]**.** In theater, we distinguish between the performer, Vladimir Vysotsky^[The role of Hamlet could be played by John Doe, whose performance pales in comparison to the talent of Vysotsky. However, both performers still play the role of Hamlet, even though their qualifications differ. Thus, we discuss roles and performers separately. The role remains the same, but the performers can vary.] and the role he plays. Even young children understand this. Yet adults sometimes fail to realize that they themselves play roles such as "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, a single actor can play different roles, and similarly, we can view anyone's actions through the lens of "role." It's fair to say that every person plays roles in their personal life or work projects, though not everyone consciously acknowledges this.

**We consciously focus on our actions** only **when we wish to improve our behavior**. If there's no need to change our thinking or work practices, there is no need for role evaluation. However, if we need to change the working principle of an individual or an entire team, the best approach today is to use the concept of "role" along with other related concepts—such as "method (practice)" and "work product."

In theater, role actions are clearly defined by a script, and performers can regularly change. In life, it's the same: different people can perform the role of a surgeon. But every surgeon operates based on certain medical practices learned in university. The concept of "role" is intricately linked to "method (practice)"; when we transition to role evaluation, we must discuss role practices^[As well as work products, systems, and much more. Systems thinking introduces specific concepts and shows how they are interconnected.].

Hence, a **role**^[The concept of "role" has synonyms—role-based or functional object.] is a culturally established term: surgeon, footballer, driver, hammer^[Recall the consideration of the "hammer" from the previous section.] or automobile, etc. A role is performed by a specific agent, referred to as the **role performer**. From the theatrical metaphor and human actor, we transition to a more fundamental perspective, where role performers can include not just people but also other agents (like artificial intelligence, a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a stone).

Actions by an agent for a role constitute **role behavior**, which is performed according to certain rules or through specific **methods (practices)**. Role performers use practices to create **work products**. Let's delve deeper into the following:

* The concept of a role applies not only to humans, although we began our exploration through a theatrical metaphor;
* Roles are not possessed by people, but people engage in activities (processes) or are part of a system through roles;
* A role performer is not necessarily a human, so we will refer to an agent as the role performer or an inanimate object;
* Agents can be both humans and inanimate systems;
* The success of a system depends on roles and their interests;
* Roles execute practices and produce work products.
