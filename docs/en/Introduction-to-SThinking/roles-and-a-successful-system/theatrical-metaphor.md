title: Theatrical Metaphor
---

To understand what "role" means, let's turn to the theater. Everyone knows the phrase, "All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players." This idea offers not only philosophical insight but is also useful in systems thinking.

Theatrical metaphors help explain the difference between action and the performer of the action, or between **the role and the executor of the role**^[It’s important not to think that I am a collection of roles. I am the performer of a specific role in a particular situation or project. However, I possess the mastery to play numerous different roles.]**.** In theater, we distinguish between the performer like Vladimir Vysotsky^[The role of Hamlet can be performed by John Doe, whose performance might pale in comparison to V. Vysotsky's talent. Nevertheless, both performers play the role of Hamlet, albeit with different qualifications. Therefore, we'll talk separately about roles and performers. The role is the same, but the performers may differ.] and the role he plays. Even small children understand this. Yet adults sometimes don't realize that they themselves play roles such as "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, the same actor can play different roles, and any person's actions can be viewed through the concept of "role." It's fair to say that everyone plays roles in their personal lives or work projects. It's just that not everyone thinks about it.

**We consciously pay attention to our actions** only **when we want to improve our behavior**. If there's no need to change our thinking or work practices, there's no need for role consideration. However, if it's important for us to change the working principle of an individual or an entire team, the best current approach is to use the concept of "role," along with other related concepts like "method (practice)" and "work product."

In theater, actions by role are clearly defined by the script, and performers can regularly change. In life, it's much the same: different people can play the role of a surgeon, but every surgeon acts based on certain medical practices studied in university. The concept of "role" is inseparable from the concept of "method (practice)"; as soon as we switch to role consideration, we must discuss role practices^[And also work products, systems, and much more. Systems thinking introduces specific concepts and shows how they are interconnected.].

So, **a role**^[The concept of "role" has synonyms—role-based or functional object.] is a name well-established culturally: surgeon, soccer player, driver, hammer^[Recall the discussion of "hammer" from the previous section.] or car, etc. A role is performed by a certain agent, whom we call the **executor of the role**. From the theatrical metaphor and the human-actor, we move to a more fundamental view where role executors can be not only people, but also, for example, other agents (like artificial intelligence, a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a stone).

Actions of an agent by role are part of **role behavior**, which is performed according to specific rules or using a specific **method (practice)**. Executors of roles use practices to create **work products**. Let's explore further:

* The concept of a role pertains not only to humans, though we began understanding it through theater metaphors;
* Roles don't belong to a person; rather, a person in a role participates in some activity (process) or is part of a system;
* The executor of a role isn't necessarily a human, which is why we'll refer to an agent as the executor of the role or to an inanimate object;
* Agents can be both people and inanimate systems;
* The success of a system depends on roles and their interests;
* Roles execute practice and create work products.
