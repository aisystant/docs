title: Role as a Model of Thinking
---

A regular person acts intuitively or based on experience, and their role behavior is influenced by the theory they absorbed earlier^[A person can unconsciously assimilate theory through interactions with others. Often, people learn unconsciously by absorbing information from their environment or mimicking someone they see as an authority.]. We often say that a person acts according to their **Worldviews**.

**Worldviews** can be shaped by scientific theories or grandmother's superstitions. Scientific theories and disciplines provide a better description of role behavior, but non-scientific worldviews are simpler and therefore more popular among most people. When we talk about an engineer's worldview, we primarily mean the engineering methods they learned in university and further developed in their professional life.

A conscious approach to learning professional roles involves setting appropriate practices. You could say that a person instills discipline in their mind and masters the skill of using **tools (technologies).** For example, a driver learns the traffic rules and practices driving a car. Rules represent theory (discipline), while the car is the tool. With this knowledge, one can say the person has mastered the role of a driver, meaning they have learned the practice of "driving a car," through which they achieve their work product—transported physical objects (people, goods).

A similar mode of thinking can be applied to all activities a person engages in, not only in work but also in **personal life**. For instance, one could identify roles such as son, educator, student, motivator, dish washer, room cleaner, metro passenger, and so on. We consider these roles like professional ones, focusing on methods (theories, technologies, and work products).

A role-based perspective allows one to pay special or **formal attention**^[This means highlighting the theory along with its concepts, principles, etc.] to their behavior. For example, while learning to swim, we realize the need to master the technique (method, practice) of crawl stroke to professionally fulfill the role of a swimmer^[Note that the concepts of "role," "method," and "role behavior" are intentionally used side by side in the text. You need to train your mind to distinguish these concepts. Just like you differentiate between other classes of concepts, for instance, not confusing furniture with colors, and discussing chairs, tables, and cupboards separately from their colors, sizes, etc. Such a type classifier or cognitive type machine develops in a person over time, but specifically learning this can significantly accelerate the process. Both 'time on task' and quality learning (which reduces the required time) are important. Read more about the cognitive type classifier in the textbook "Systems Thinking"]. In critical parenting situations, it's essential not to resort to poor automatic reactions and stress but, recalling the role of educator, to seek a good method to apply when dealing with a child.

When embarking on learning, it helps to understand the established **student practices or what it means to know how to learn**. The concept of "role" allows an unconscious act to become conscious, focusing on formal objects of attention (method, system, other roles, etc.). Typically, people learn unconsciously, unable to name the formal methods of learning (practices), that is, how or with which practices they learn.

**Consider** **which methods** **you use to learn.** For instance, why the first homework assignment involved systematic reading and controlling information consumption, the Pomodoro Technique, and time investment, along with thinking through writing and thinking by speaking. These were the main practices of a student's role^[All of these are detailed in the "Practices of Self-Development" course.].

However, we don’t always need to be fully conscious or formally examine our actions. Behavioral automatisms save attention; therefore, some roles we perform unconsciously. For example, when brushing teeth or taking a shower. **If we don't want to change behavior or the world around us,** **we can avoid burdening ourselves** **with role examination.** But if you need to set or change the process of brushing teeth, then you should consciously identify the role of the tooth cleaner and find the best oral hygiene method. After that, you examine and master the tool—such as the toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, irrigator—bringing this role behavior to an automatism.

Altering one's behavior is literally a change in thinking (adopting new techniques), and for this, attention to one's actions is necessary. The **concept of "role" as a model of thinking** enables this, and thinking mastery helps find and quickly establish the needed practical application.

It's crucial to understand that behind every project role there is a **method (practice)** **and a work product.** By naming a person according to a role, we simultaneously define a whole class of practices by which the role creates work products. For instance, for the role of a swimmer, we immediately outline possible classes of practices—crawl, breaststroke, butterfly—and when speaking of an entrepreneur, we'll consider different practices—Business Model Canvas, Lean Startup, Lean Canvas, and others. Hopefully, you understand that each role has a vast number of practices: unique ones for a surgeon, operations manager, financier, engineer, architect, educator, etc.

In ancient times, masters simply did their jobs without much thought on strict formalization of their actions. Yet, unique historical objects were created then. However, the complexity of today’s world is entirely different, and through the formalization of work methods, a larger number of people can become masters in their fields, and to a large extent, humanity can create numerous successful systems.

Without role-based examination, it's impossible to tackle the complexity of the current stage of humanity’s development. A modern individual will always be in demand if they continually learn and retrain in a timely manner. Systems thinking is a **way** **to formalize** the actions and behaviors of numerous interested people. The concept of "role" is key to such formalization.
