title: Successful System
---

In modern systems thinking, the concept of a "successful system" is introduced through project roles, subjects of interest, and role interests.

A system is considered successful if it accounts for the role interests of all external and internal project roles. The project team identifies all relevant project roles and tries to determine all possible subjects of interest. Then, they consider the preferences of the identified roles concerning these subjects. After that, the team decides which project roles' interests will be addressed during the creation of the system. The challenge lies in dealing with multiple systems simultaneously without confusing the subjects of interest.

The thinking approach involves accounting for the maximum number of roles and their subjects of interest, while only satisfying the role interests (preferences) of those roles selected by the team. It is impossible to satisfy all role interests due to constraints of time and resources. However, by considering everything and meeting only the main subjects of interest and corresponding role interests, the team takes calculated risks, understanding what costs might be incurred. For this, the team needs transdisciplinary ethics. The larger your market or the more complex the system, the greater the need for professional philosophers who practice applied ethics. For example, understanding why it is necessary to consider environmentalists' interests and not workers' interests is covered in detail in an ethics course.

For instance, the team may consider the buyer's interest in a low price, but they are not obligated to satisfy it. After evaluating this role interest, the team might decide to set a higher price than preferred. By setting a certain price, the team might make a mistake and bear the consequences, such as lost profit or reduced market share. It's critical to avoid fatal mistakes, though obvious mistakes are inevitable. An important technique here is hypothesis setting and continuous development, applying the principle of incremental development instead of a fixed lifecycle.

It's important to note that the team must not only decide which preferences to consider but also strive to identify all possible subjects of interest, which often extend beyond financial aspects.

In your projects, you primarily discuss subjects like profit, timelines, and quality, indicating that specific project roles are defining their role interests. They prefer increased profit, shortened timelines, and enhanced quality. From the systems thinking perspective, a system cannot be called successful if only these role interests are satisfied. If a system could potentially harm human health, the company will face repercussions.

Thus, the team first identifies all possible project roles and their subjects of interest. Each role interest is then examined to determine whether it should be satisfied. This is a conscious decision for which the team is accountable. The team stakes their reputation when deciding which project roles' interests will be addressed during the project and ultimately satisfied in the system.

The team may decide not to satisfy certain role interests. But if they have considered all subjects of interest and preferences, they have acknowledged them. However, not all might be satisfied. Considering and satisfying are different things.

In the diagram above, you see how systems thinking proposes achieving a successful system. Notice that each word on this chart represents a significant effort. In the course, we will discuss all these concepts and actions that project roles must take to achieve a successful system.
