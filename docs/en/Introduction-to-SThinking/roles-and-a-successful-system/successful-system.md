title: Successful System
---

In modern systems thinking, the concept of a “**successful system**” is introduced through project roles, subjects of interest, and role interests.

**A system is considered successful if it accounts for the role interests of all external and internal project roles**. The project team identifies all interested project roles and strives to determine all possible subjects of interest. Next, they consider the preferences of the identified roles in the corresponding subjects of interest. After that, the team decides which project roles’ interests will be addressed during the creation of the system^[Multiple systems are considered within the project, which adds complexity. It’s crucial not to get confused about the subjects of interest.].

The thought process involves accounting for (counting) the maximum number of roles and their subjects of interest, while fulfilling the role interests (preferences) only of the roles selected by the team. **It's impossible to satisfy all role interests**. There isn't enough time and resources for that. However, by considering everything and satisfying only the main subjects of interest and corresponding role interests, the team takes on risks or, metaphorically, puts their "skin in the game," understanding the potential costs they might incur. For this, the team requires transdisciplinary ethics^[The larger your market or the more complex the system, the greater the need for professional philosophers who practice applied ethics. For instance, why the interests of environmentalists should be considered but not workers' interests is detailed further in the ethics course.].

For example, the team can **consider** a buyer's interest in a low price but is not required to **satisfy** this preference. By addressing this role interest, the team may decide to set the price higher than the preference. Setting a certain price, the team might miscalculate and face the consequences in the form of lost profits or reduced market share. In such decisions, a **fatal mistake** cannot be made, but common mistakes are inevitable. An important technique here is formulating hypotheses and continual development^[We apply the principle of incremental development (based on trial and error) instead of a specific pre-planned life cycle.].

Let's note that the team must not only choose which preferences to consider but also strive to identify all possible subjects of interest, which are not solely financial.

Notice that in your projects, the primary subjects of interest discussed are profit, timelines, and quality. This implies that certain project roles express their role interests^[They prefer higher profits, shorter timelines, and higher quality.]. From a systems thinking perspective, we cannot call a system successful if only these role interests are satisfied. For instance, if a system can harm human health, the company might face serious consequences in the future.

Therefore, the team initially identifies all possible project roles and their subjects of interest. Then, it reviews each role interest and decides what to do with it: satisfy it or not? This is a conscious decision for which the team is responsible. The team puts their "skin in the game" when determining the list of project roles whose role interests will be addressed and ultimately satisfied in the system.

The team might decide not to satisfy some role interests. But if the team has considered all subjects of interest and preferences, it means they have been acknowledged. However, not all might be satisfied. **Acknowledging and satisfying are different things**.

The diagram above illustrates how systems thinking proposes to achieve a successful system. Notice that there is considerable work behind each word in this diagram. In the course, we will discuss all these concepts and actions that project roles must perform to achieve a successful system.
