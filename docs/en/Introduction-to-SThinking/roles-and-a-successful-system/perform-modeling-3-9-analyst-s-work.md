title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.9. Work of an Analyst'
---

### Translation:

Consider how an analyst differs from an engineer. Indicate the percentage of your time spent on analytical work versus the time spent on engineering work:

* Engaging in activities that do not lead to decisions being made by others without additional questions—creating internal work products;
* Making decisions that change the surrounding world, where everyone understands these are your decisions and your responsibility, without interference—creating external work products.

Please record these figures in a table: it's preferable to extract these numbers from your Pomodoro exocortex. You may choose to separate work-related and personal projects.

**Locate the corresponding task by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
