title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.9. Analyst''s Work'
---

Text to translate:

Consider the difference between an analyst and an engineer. Record the percentage of your time spent on analytical work versus engineering work:

* Engaging in activities that do not lead to your decisions being accepted by others without additional questions—creating internal work products;
* Implementing your decisions in the surrounding world, where everyone understands they are your decisions and your responsibility without interference—creating external work products.

Record these figures in a table; it's preferable to extract these figures from your Pomodoro exocortex. You can separate work and personal projects.

**Locate the corresponding assignment by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.**
