title: Role as Part of a System or Activity
---

As you already know, the concept of a "role" isn't limited to just people. A role can be performed by something other than a person, even a "stone." Now, let's go further and state that roles don't belong to a person, as is commonly thought. In systems thinking, a role is viewed **as part of a system or activity.**

A role is referred to as a **functional object.** The concept of a "functional object" pertains to considering a "system": when we speak^[When we use words or concepts, we direct attention. Each concept highlights something specific. We cannot view the world in its entirety, and examining even a system entirely is challenging due to computational limitations. However, we can focus on specific aspects within the system. For example, the subject of interest might be cost. The concept of the "subject of interest" remains connected to the whole system, ensuring we do not lose sight while discussing a single aspect.] about being interested in a system as a functional object, it means we are interested in its role-based (or functional) behavior, not its physical embodiment.

For example, we previously discussed the role of a hammer, considering separately the physical object and the system both termed "hammer." If the role "hammer" is needed, it implies there is a supersystem or a process requiring the function of driving nails.

We can certainly consider a physical object (even a person) and say they can play certain roles. For example, a stone can play the role of a hammer or a paperweight, while a person can play the role of a manager or a driver. However, we do not say that the role of a hammer or paperweight is inside or is part of the stone. Similarly, **we will not say that the role of a manager, driver, or father is inside a person.**

Whenever we discuss a role, we should subsequently consider **in what context this role should be further examined,** and by **what method it is realized to produce a certain work product.** When discussing a system (not a project), we can talk about role-based or functional decomposition. For example, a driver is part of the "driver + vehicle" system.

We can **discuss a system from different perspectives,** one of which is **functional or role-based.** In this perspective, we focus on the system being a functional object, meaning it fulfills a certain role. This is the fundamental view of the system as a "black box." This approach means we are interested in the role-based behavior rather than the system's internal configuration.

A system as a **"black box"** exhibits its role-based (functional) behavior outwardly, while considering a system as a **"transparent box"** shifts our focus to its internal structure. You will learn about viewing systems as a "transparent box" in Section 6, "Systems Modeling."
