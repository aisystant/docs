title: Role as Part of a System or Activity
---

As you already know, the concept of "role" is not limited to humans. The executor/performer of a role can be not just a person, but even a "stone." Let's go a step further and say that roles do not belong to a person, as is commonly thought. In systems thinking, a role is considered **as part of a system or activity.**

A role is defined as a **functional object.** The concept of a "functional object" relates to the consideration of a "system": when we say^[When we use words as concepts, we manage attention. Each concept "highlights" something specific. We cannot view the world in its entirety, and even viewing a single system in full is challenging due to computational limits. However, we can focus on specific elements within the system. For example, if our subject of interest is cost. In doing so, the concept of "subject of interest" is connected with the entire system, and discussing one element doesn't mean we lose connection to the whole.], that a system interests us as a functional object, we are concerned not with its physical embodiment but with its role-based (or functional) behavior.

For example, we previously discussed the role of a hammer, thus separately considering both the physical object and the system called by the single word â€“ "hammer." If we need the role of a "hammer," it means there is some overarching system or process where the function of driving nails is required.

Of course, we can consider a physical object (even a person) and say that it can perform certain roles. For instance, a stone can serve as a hammer or a paperweight, while a person can play the role of a manager or a driver. However, we don't say that the role of a hammer or paperweight is inherent within or a part of the stone. Similarly, **we won't say that the role of a manager, driver, or father is inherent within a person.**

Whenever discussing a role, we must, in the next step, think about **what larger context this role should be considered within, and what method it utilizes to achieve a specific work product.** If we're talking about a system (not a project), we can discuss role-based or functional decomposition. For example, a driver is part of the "driver+automobile" system.

We can **discuss a system from different perspectives, and one such perspective is functional or role-based.** Here, we focus on the system as a functional object, meaning it performs a role. This is the primary way of viewing a system as a "black box." This approach means we're interested not in the system's structure but in its role-based behavior.

The system as a **"black box"** exhibits role-based (functional) behavior outwardly, while a system as a **"transparent box"** directs our attention to how it is structured internally. You'll explore the concept of the system as a "transparent box" in Section 6, "Systems Modeling."
