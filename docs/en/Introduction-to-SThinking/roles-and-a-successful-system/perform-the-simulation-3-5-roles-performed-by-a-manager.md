title: 'Perform Simulation: 3.5. Roles Executed by the Manager'

Text to translate:

Review the example in the first row of the table. Record for your boss at least three roles you know he has fulfilled over the past few months (if possible, order them by the time they were carried out). Don't forget about roles like "strategist," "leader," "organizer," along with other managerial and entrepreneurial roles, which are akin to organizational engineers' roles (unlike operational engineers, organizational engineers often don't consider this part of their job, but it is; it requires mastery and significant time and resource investment). If you lack the perspective to find the right words and titles, use ChatGPT, Google, or consult knowledgeable experts.

List the roles you perform as a leader in professional or personal projects. If you think you don't act as a leader anywhere, that's an obvious mistake. If needed, engage in thinking through writing to reflect on this question.
