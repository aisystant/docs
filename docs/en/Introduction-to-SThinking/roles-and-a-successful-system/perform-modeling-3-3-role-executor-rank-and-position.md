## Instructions for Completing the Table

Review the example provided in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the differences between the concepts of "role" and "position," "rank" and "qualification." Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Recall the names of people you know who fit these descriptions. If your knowledge is limited in terms of finding the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with familiar experts. Describe your colleagues from both professional and personal projects.

Make notes as needed when revisiting and filling out the template tables. You may record reflections and results from your mistake analysis.
