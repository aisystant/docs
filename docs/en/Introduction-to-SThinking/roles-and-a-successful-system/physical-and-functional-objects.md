title: Physical and Functional Objects

Let's explore **how a role differs from a project role**.

A project role is always performed by a person or an agent, not by an inanimate object like a stone, which lacks intention. The term "role" can be applied not only to agents. After all, a role is a functional object, and its executor is some physical object. This object can be either an agent or a non-agent without intention.

Consider the example of a taxi. In a taxi, the role of the driver can be performed by a human or a robot with artificial intelligence (a nuanced topic, as we might soon discuss AI's intentions). In the first case, we refer to a project role to emphasize human involvement. But when we say "there is a driver's role in a taxi," we allow for the possibility that this role can be performed by either a person or an inanimate object.

It's essential to understand the division into:

* **Physical Object**: This could be a person, AI, or another inanimate object. Note that when we speak of a physical object, we're indicating something that exists in the physical world. We don't know what role this physical object might play^ [In essence, a stone is a typical physical object with unclear function. When a function is needed, like driving a nail or holding papers down, we talk about functional objects — like a hammer or paperweight. The stone's nature becomes secondary.]. The key is recognizing a physical object exists in 4D — three-dimensional space and time.
  
* **Functional Object**: This is the role itself. In the example above, it's the role of the driver. When discussing a functional object, we're focused not just on the physical object but the role. So it’s not merely a person, but a driver with specific skills. What matters is the behavior of this functional object, not which physical object performs this role^ [Integrating the physical object with the functional one is necessary for system creation, but we should distinguish and discuss these entities separately.];
  
* **Role or Functional Behavior**: We state that a functional object has specific role or functional behavior, viewing the system as a "black box"^ [Here, we are unconcerned with inner workings. More on system design (as a "white box") can be found in section 6, "Systems Modeling."]. For example, a driver's role involves the behavior of managing a vehicle.

This division into **physical object, functional object (role), and role behavior** is a key approach in systems thinking.

Initially, we identify a need for a function like driving a nail. **Function is behavior**. This function is linked to the role of "nail driver," and then an executor is appointed to this role. It does not necessarily have to be the hammer^ [Culturally, “hammer” is used instead of “nail driver.” The term "hammer" has become culturally conditioned and is as commonly used as “driver.” Terms frequently anchor to functional objects. No need to say "car operator" — just "driver," the same logic follows for "hammer." So, a hammer is a functional object, while the physical object can be a stone, microscope, or hammer. Here, it’s implied as a specific tool as a physical object.], lying in my garage. The needed role of "nail driver" could be filled by a microscope in a lab or a stone outside my window^ [Here, focus is on specific objects — microscope and stone, not abstract instances.].

Engineers design systems similarly. First, they determine the necessary functions, naming the system based on this function-behavior, giving it a functional name or role. Then, the most suitable modules or physical objects are chosen for these functional roles.

The role-based approach applies equally to agents and "hardware" non-agent systems when considering them in role-executor capacities. The behavior of an agent is termed **role behavior**, while that of a "hardware" system is the system function. Although discussing the role behavior of a car isn't incorrect.

However, there are deeper distinctions. For instance, persuading a person to adopt the required role is necessary, unlike a microscope, which doesn’t need convincing to function as a hammer^ [Implied technical solutions are covered by formal engineering methods. Once correctly deployed, a "hardware" system cannot escape its assigned role.]. In systems with people, **leadership practice** is key, focusing on guiding individuals to perform their roles effectively, efficiently, and with pleasure. A leader places people into roles. Systematic leadership involves helping others assume certain roles. In contrast, placing "hardware" systems into roles relies on standard engineering methods and physical theories.

For example, as a manager, a person might formally reprimand an employee for not meeting obligations during a meeting. But the same person, as a leader, might later have a heartfelt discussion to understand the employee's challenges.

Another distinction is that a "hardware" system lacks role interests, while a project role possesses them. Successful systems begin by identifying involved project roles and then their role interests. Human behavior is driven by **"intention,"** whereas roles have **"preferences."**
