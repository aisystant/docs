### Understanding the Difference Between a Role and a Project Role

A project role is always fulfilled by a person or an agent, not an object like a rock, which lacks intention. The concept of "role" can be applied beyond just agents. A role is a functional object, while its executor/performer is a physical object. This could be either an agent or a non-agent without intention.

Let's consider the example of a taxi. The driver's role in a taxi can be performed by a human or a robot with artificial intelligence (and here we touch on the fine point that soon we may discuss AI intentions). In the first case, we refer to it as a project role to emphasize human involvement. However, when saying "there is a driver's role in a taxi," we imply that this role can be performed by either a human or an inanimate object.

It's crucial to clearly understand the distinction between:

* **Physical Object**: This includes humans, AI, or any other inanimate objects. Note that when we refer to a physical object, we're indicating something that exists in the physical world. We don't necessarily know which role this physical object might fulfill. For example, a stone is a typical physical object with an unclear function. If someone needs to accomplish something specific—like driving a nail into wood or holding down papers—they require a specific function, like a hammer or a paperweight. At this point, we focus on functional objects rather than the stone itself. The important aspect when calling it a physical object is that it exists in the four-dimensional realm (three-dimensional space and time).

* **Functional Object**: Essentially, this is the role. In the above example, the driver's role. Discussing a functional object highlights that there is more than just a physical object—it’s a specific role, such as a skilled driver. We focus on the behavior of this functional object, not which physical object will fulfill this role. The integration of a physical object with a functional one is necessary when creating a system, but we must be able to separately acknowledge and discuss these two entities.

* **Role or Functional Behavior**: We assert that a functional object exhibits specific role or functional behavior, where the system is viewed as a "black box". Here, we are not concerned with the internal structure. The internal workings of the system (viewed as a transparent box) will be explained further in Section 6 "System Modeling". For instance, the driver's role involves the behavior of driving a car.

Such separation into **physical object, functional object (role), and role behavior** is a key technique in systems thinking.

For example, first, we understand that we need a nail-driving function. **Function refers to behavior**. This function is attached to the role of "nail driver," and then an executor is assigned to this role. It doesn't have to be a physical hammer lying in my garage. The required role of "nail driver" can be fulfilled by this microscope in the laboratory or a stone visible from my window. Here, we emphasize that we're talking about specific objects—the microscope and the stone—not abstract instances.

Similarly, engineers design systems. First, they determine what functions are needed, and based on these functions-behaviors, they name the system, giving it a functional name or role. Then, they select modules or physical objects that best fit these functional roles.

The role-based approach is the same for agents and "metallic" inanimate systems when viewed as executors of specific roles. Behavior of an agent represents **role behavior**, while behavior of a "metallic" system is a system function. Even referring to a vehicle's behavior as role behavior isn't incorrect.

However, there are deeper distinctions. For example, to persuade a person to assume a role, they must be encouraged, whereas a microscope doesn't require persuading to execute the role of a hammer. Rather, these "persuasions" follow formal engineering methods. If calculations are correct, a metallic system cannot avoid executing the prescribed role. Thus, in systems involving humans, **leadership practice** is key, which involves compelling a person to assume and efficiently execute their role with satisfaction. A leader can effectively place a person into a role. Systems leadership technique aids others in assuming specific roles. The assignment of roles to "metallic" systems occurs through standard engineering methods based on physical theories.

For instance, a person in a managerial role may issue a reprimand for a task not completed, acting within managerial practices. However, the same person, in a leadership role, might have an empathetic discussion with an employee to uncover the issues behind their challenges.

Another difference is that "metallic" systems lack role interests, which only exist in project roles. To create a successful system, interested project roles are identified first, followed by their role interests. Human behavior is driven by **"intention,"** whereas a role has **"preferences."**
