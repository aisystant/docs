title: 'Perform Simulation: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations'
---

Here is the translation of the text:

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Note that a well-crafted action description implies a role. Some roles are culturally conditioned, meaning they are widely recognized. Try to identify these roles by using resources like ChatGPT or Google, or by consulting with familiar experts. Survey three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not just desk work; you will need to communicate a lot with different people! Don't postpone this task, start today. For instance, write, call, or chat over a cup of coffee with colleagues. Avoid recording information about colleagues that you already know!

After this, fill in a row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Begin by describing your activities in any way you can, then make corrections. Draft a blog post about it on Aisystant.
