title: '"Role" and "Method"'
---

When we consider project roles, we inevitably connect them with practices (methods). We'll use the terms "method" and "practice" synonymously. In systems thinking, the term "method" carries a different meaning from its common usage^[For instance, when discussing the contrast between theory and practice.]. We need this concept to discuss the formal description of actions performed by project roles. Project roles operate according to a **method** (**practice**), and each role may perform many of these, helping to create work products. For example, a swimmer can swim in different styles (often the term "style" is a synonym for method and practice, and is also referred to as technique)â€”freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, etc.

There are methods for surgeons, dentists, entrepreneurs, engineers, marketers, and so on. People study applied methods (practices) to more effectively create work products. Be sure to list the methods you consciously use, and then add the **work products** you achieve with them.

In your work, you apply various methods to create work products. You may engage in either analytical or engineering work. In the first case, you create **internal work products**, meaning something for yourself. For example, you might make your own plans, analyze completed work, or gather data. In the second case, you create **external work products**, which you deliver to others. In this scenario, unlike the first, your decisions alter the surrounding world.

Pay attention to how much time you spend as an analyst and how much as an engineer. In the evening, compile or recall a list of the external and internal work products you created^[For more on enhancing personal effectiveness, you can explore the "Practices of Self-Development" course.].
