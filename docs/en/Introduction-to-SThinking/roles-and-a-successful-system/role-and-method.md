title: '"Role" and "Method"'
---

When we examine project roles, we must always link them to practices (methods). We'll use the terms method and practice interchangeably going forward. In systems thinking, the concept of "method" does not carry the same meaning as it does in everyday language^[For example, when discussing the contrast between theory and practice.]. We need this concept to discuss the formal description of the actions of project roles. Project roles operate according to a **method** (**practice**), and each role can perform multiple methods, through which work products are created. For instance, a swimmer can swim using different styles (often the words "style," "method," and "practice" are synonymous, and sometimes the term technique is used) â€“ freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, etc.

There are methods for surgeons, dentists, entrepreneurs, engineers, marketers, and so on. People learn applied methods (practices) to more effectively create work products. It's essential to make a list of methods you consciously use and then add the **work products** you obtain with their help.

In your work process, you apply various methods to create work products. You could be engaged in either analytical or engineering work. In the first scenario, you create **internal work products**, meaning something for yourself. For example, preparing your plans, analyzing work you've done, or gathering data. In the second scenario, you create **external work products**, which you provide to others. In this case, unlike the first, your decisions influence the surrounding world.

Pay attention to how much time you spend as an analyst and how much as an engineer. In the evening, compile or recall a list of created external and internal work products^[For more details on enhancing personal efficiency, you can refer to the course "Practices of Self-Development."].
