Alongside the concept of a role, terms like position, rank, and qualification are also used. They help to best describe human activity.

**Qualification and rank are characteristics of a role performer.** Qualification denotes the level of mastery a person has in executing a role. This evaluation is granted by an organization, community, or state. Rank is conferred by competent authorities and signifies a person's standing within a certain hierarchy established by those authorities, such as in science, the military, or video games. Aisystant also has its own qualifications^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>] and 8 qualification levels.

**Position** defines the ability and duty to play specific roles and sets the authorities regarding the allocation of resources (money, performers' time). For example, job descriptions include duties that can be understood as obligations to play some roles and the capacity to play others. HR and position-specific documents determine which financial, material, and human resources a person can manage in a particular position. A person is appointed to a position and signs relevant documents about their rights and responsibilities. For instance, someone might be appointed to the position of enterprise manager.

An ordinary person might say that after being appointed to a position, an individual is obliged to follow job descriptions, whereas from a systems thinking perspective, one could say that **in a position, a person has the opportunity and obligation to play appropriate roles and manage certain resources.**

**An enterprise manager is a position** that requires a person to at least play the roles of manager and leader. They are responsible for the enterprise's resources and have the ability to play any role in their enterprise. And who could forbid them?^[Some managers take advantage of this, centralizing decision-making and assuming all roles themselves, leaving employees to merely prepare documents without making decisions or putting their expertise to use. Imagine a surgeon who, during an operation, goes to the head doctor to approve the incision site.]

Thus, an employee of an enterprise can be viewed from several perspectives:

* Functional consideration – role, role actions, methods.
* Organizational consideration – position, subordination and leadership, resource allocation, organization, and task execution.

A person-agent in a position^[And accordingly, having the right and/or obligation to fulfill certain roles.] with specific resources (financial, technological, etc.) is the minimal **organizational unit.** Organizational units also include divisions: departments, sectors, and holding company enterprises.

When designing organizations, **organizational places** are highlighted: positions and roles in staffing charts (in organigrams), vacancies, etc. This allows one to see the subordination structure of some organizational places to others. When a person-agent occupies an organizational place, an organizational unit is formed. **An organization** is a structured group of people who understand their authorities, subordination, roles, and responsibilities for resources.
