Alongside the concept of "role," terms like position, rank, and qualification are also used. These help describe human activities more effectively.

**Qualification and rank are characteristics of the executor/performer in a role.** Qualification indicates the level of mastery an individual has in performing a specific role. This assessment is usually provided by an organization, community, or the state. Rank is granted by competent authorities and reflects a person’s standing within a particular hierarchy set by these authorities, such as in science, the military, computer games, etc. Aisystant also includes its own qualification system^[<https://system-school.ru/qualification>] with eight qualification levels.

**Position** **defines the ability and obligation to play specific roles and sets authorities concerning the management of resources** (such as money and performers' time). For instance, job descriptions outline duties that can be understood as obligations to play certain roles and opportunities to play others. HR and position-specific documents specify which financial, material, and human resources a person in a certain position can manage. An individual is appointed to a position and signs relevant documents regarding their rights and responsibilities, like being appointed as the head of an enterprise.

An ordinary person might say that after being appointed to a position, one is required to adhere to job descriptions, whereas from a systems thinking perspective, one could say that **holding a position provides the opportunity and obligation to play corresponding roles and manage certain resources.**

**The head of an enterprise is a position** that requires a person to play at least the roles of a manager and a leader. This person is responsible for the enterprise's resources and has the opportunity to play any role within the enterprise. Who can forbid them?^[Some leaders take advantage of this opportunity and centralize all decision-making. They personally play all roles, while employees only prepare documents without making decisions based on their professional roles or stepping into the spotlight. Imagine a surgeon who, during an operation, goes to the chief physician to get approval on where to make an incision.]

Therefore, an enterprise employee can be viewed from several perspectives:

* Functional consideration – role, actions related to the role, methods;
* Organizational consideration – position, subordination and leadership, resource management, organization and execution of work.

A person-agent in a position^[Having the right and/or obligation to perform specific roles, accordingly.] with certain resources (financial, technological, etc.) forms a basic **organizational unit.** Units also include departments, divisions, and enterprises of a holding.

When designing organizations, **organizational places** are identified: positions and slots in the staffing plan (org charts), vacancies, etc. This way, one can see how some organizational places are subordinate to others. When a person-agent takes an organizational place, an organizational unit emerges. **An organization** is an organized group of people who understand their authorities, subordination, roles, and accountability for resources.
