title: 'Perform Modeling: 5.2. Annotating with Types Using Notation ::'
---

Please refer to the example in the first row of the table. Utilize the most convenient markup for types in the textâ€”double colons "::". Start by writing the name of the object, followed by its type from the meta-model (or additionally from the meta-meta-model). For instance: "an airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object." If needed, revisit the theoretical material on the :: notation in the "Rational Work" course.

For the sentences in the table, create duplicates by indicating the types of all objects and relationships, as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and provide a few examples from work-related and personal projects.
