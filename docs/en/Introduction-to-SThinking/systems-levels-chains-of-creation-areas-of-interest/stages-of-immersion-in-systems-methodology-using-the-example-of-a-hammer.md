title: Stages of Immersion in Systems Methodology Using the Example of a "Hammer"
---

Let's examine the progress of learning systems thinking by continuing our example with the hammer discussed in previous sections.

In student culture, there are anecdotes about how university students think, particularly highlighting how senior students often know more about life than freshmen. Similarly, in our school, this dynamic is evident when a teacher asks a student, "Provide an example of a physical object." The way you answer this question can reflect the depth of your immersion in systems thinking.

A student enrolled in the "Systems Self-Development" preparatory course would answer the question about a physical object with "a hammer." This response would be accepted. In the preparatory courses at Aisystant, the emphasis is primarily on distinguishing **between** the physical world and the mental realm. This distinction is crucial to separate concepts like "age," "freedom," "love," or "theory" from tangible objects like "a hammer," "a textbook," or "shorts."

A student taking the "Rational Work" course or someone with admirable **ontological mastery**—though it's not mandatory to complete the "Rational Work" course, it's extremely beneficial for developing ontological thinking, which is essential to systems thinking—cannot respond like a preparatory program student. They understand that the word "hammer" might refer to an instance of the class "Carpentry Tools." Therefore, it's insufficient to simply say "a hammer." The appropriate response would be, "this large hammer in your hand." It's necessary to specify the context to indicate that it's about a specific physical object rather than an ideal abstract object (an instance of some class).

A systems thinking student would go further—they can consider not just the physical object but also the **system** "hammer." They understand that while there is the word "hammer," it can signify different things in various contexts, such as a class instance, a specific physical object, or a system. In the latter case, the system "hammer" could be "this stone in my hand."

It aligns with the well-known phrase: "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo"—meaning different actions or entities. The word "hammer" is singular, but it can denote very **different types**, and consciously deciphering this is key. Such a skill may not stand out in everyday life, but in complex projects, lacking this understanding can make success elusive.

The demonstrated gradual **immersion in a complex methodology** using the hammer is a cultural norm in education. Just as children learn about numbers, then natural numbers, and proceed through integers, rational, real, and eventually, complex numbers, our approach to learning complex systems thinking is structured similarly. This ensures some early lessons might need refining with deeper methodological insights.

Someone studying systems thinking is adept at general systems thinking strategies, understands various kinds of systems, and appreciates how **systems approach 3.0** differs from previous generations. In the following courses of the main "Organizational Development" program, you will learn specific principles for working with different types of systems, such as individuals, enterprises, IT systems, or automobiles.
