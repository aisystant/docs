title: 'Perform Simulation: 5.6. Allocation of Time Among Three Areas of Interest'
---

Analyze how much time you dedicate to working with different areas of interest: target system/engineering, supersystem/commercial, and system creation/organizational/management. The total should add up to 100 percent of your overall time.

In your notes, you can outline your future plans for time investment.

**Locate the corresponding task in your modeling workspace by its number and complete all its points.**

| **Serial Number** | **Projects** | **Time spent on supersystem interest areas** | **Time spent on target system interest areas** | **Time spent on system creation interest areas** | **Notes** |
