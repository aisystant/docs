title: Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

### Translation:

**Areas of Interest** encompass several related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas of interest are the focus of attention for all roles within a project. Given the multitude of subjects of interest, for practical use, they can be grouped into specific areas. We categorize the areas of interest into the supersystem, target system, creation systems, as well as the specific areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager roles.

The levels in the hierarchy of systems decomposition are called **systems levels**. At each level, a systems practitioner perceives their roles, methods, systems, concepts, and so on.

**Creation Chains** refer to creation systems that plan, develop, and dispose of other creation systems.

I hope you have mastered the method of distinguishing all concepts covered in this section. Itâ€™s another matter that applying these concepts to your own project might not be immediately successful. This requires experience in implementing several projects.

**Main Concepts:** areas of interest, area of interest of the supersystem, target system, creator, specific areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, model, activity roles; systems decomposition, systems levels, meta-systems transition, emergence; creation chain; disarrays, systems approach 3.0, scalelessness, de-anthropomorphism, continuous development, multi-level evolution.
