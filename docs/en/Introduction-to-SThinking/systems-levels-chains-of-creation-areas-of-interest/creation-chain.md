title: Creation Chain
---

Another important term related to the three main types of systems is the **creation chain**. This term is closely associated with the creator or the systems involved in creation.

Let's continue examining the target system, the automobile. One of its creation systems is the car factory. To build a factory, you need a different creation system, which would be the factory's creation system. This leads to the formation of long chains.

In the case of systems like a car or a bridge, such chains are usually intuitive for many people. However, when it comes to software, these chains can be much longer and more complex. This is because software needs to connect with the physical world, meaning you need to identify how this software is related to a specific target system. Software is seldom created in isolation; it always integrates into some system in the physical world.

Consider, for example, any of the programming projects involved in creating an automobile. Why do they exist? What is all this software for? Ultimately, to produce an automobile! Systems thinking requires tracing the entire chain from the IT programs used in the project back to the automobile itself.
