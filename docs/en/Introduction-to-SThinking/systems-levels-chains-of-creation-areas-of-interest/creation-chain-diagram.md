Sometimes, it is necessary to construct logical connections to better understand the structure of complex human activities. The main goal is to find where your system and your team fit within the creation chain.

**Various systems are interconnected through the operational phase in long creation chains.** The illustration shows the stages of three systems. The run-time stage represents the operational phase.

These diagrams are useful for telling stories, such as:

* We're a startup aiming to grow into an IT company. The stages of creating an IT company are shown on line A.
* The company will produce an IT program for the digital twin of artificial structures, like bridges. Line B shows the stages of creating the IT program.
* Our IT program will be one of the creation systems that designs, builds, and participates in the operation of the bridge. Line C shows the stages of creating the bridge.

It is **important for us to extend all reasoning up to the target system — the bridge.** We must thoroughly work through this entire chain, as not all systems involved are fully documented here. There are more systems in this example.

If you don’t learn to model and document such chains, always tracing them back to the target system, you risk discussing your activities pointlessly. However, by mastering systems thinking, you will develop the skill to unravel any complex activity, breaking it down into creation chains, systems levels, systems, stages, etc.

By modeling and documenting the creation chain, you can easily explain the purpose and rationale of your project and how it will lead to the success of the target system. The further you are along the creation chain from the target system, the more focus you need to give it. It is relatively distant from you, requiring efforts from your thinking to keep it in focus. Typically, teams "can't see beyond their own noses" and avoid engaging with something so far removed from their immediate activities. However, ignoring this can cost not just time and money, but also add stress by hindering clarity and structured project work.

Using systems thinking, you identify the target system^[Before this, it is necessary to understand the supersystem, the expected behavior of the target system, etc.], and then design (describe) the entire creation chain up to "your" system ^[If it is indeed somewhere within the creation chain, and not inside the target system (as a subsystem)], without skipping any system in this chain while keeping in mind the benefit your project brings to the target system. This approach brings clarity and order to your activities: both personal life and work projects.
