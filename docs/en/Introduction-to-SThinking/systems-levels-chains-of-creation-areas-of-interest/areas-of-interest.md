title: Areas of Interest

# Translation

In Section 3, we were introduced to the concept of the "subject of interest." Several related characteristics or subjects of interest can be grouped into an **area of concern**. These various areas of concern are focal points for specific roles in a project. Since there are many subjects of interest, it is convenient to organize them into specific areas.

A systems thinker starts from the premise that **each role wants to know** (anticipates) how its preference will be considered. Therefore, roles whose subjects of interest have been chosen to be addressed need to be informed about how their concerns will be handled in order to assess the feasibility of their preferences.

The responses to each role's concerns are **descriptions presented as System Documentation (models).** Importantly, models are created only for the subjects of interest and preferences that have been chosen to be addressed. However, it doesn’t mean that each preference has to correspond to a separate model. Usually, models are not structured around preferences but around subjects or even areas of interest that the team has decided to address. For example, to satisfy the concerns of both the seller and buyer roles, a model like "cost estimate" is developed.

Since multiple systems, not just the target one, are examined simultaneously in a project, there will be many models. All these models must be interconnected. Before their creation, it is essential to determine exactly which models to develop. For example, apart from the cost estimate for the target system, expert assessments or other descriptions could also be made, and the project might require a budget for team resources (salary fund) as a description of the system's creator.

To facilitate the planning, creation, agreement, and modification of models in a project, **areas of concern** are introduced that relate to:

* The three main roles – subjects of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the columns of Table 3x3.
* The three main systems – areas of concern for the supersystem, the target system, and the creator. These are the rows of Table 3x3.

Each area of concern will have its own models, its own roles’ subjects of interest, and their preferences, as well as work products. One could say that Table 3x3 highlights particular subjects of interest for the main roles at the level of specific subsystems. It serves as a sort of checklist. Accordingly, in any project, you can create a list of documents (descriptions, models) that cover specific cells of the table.

**The three areas of concern for the main roles draw attention to the necessity for executors** of all the roles specified in Table 3x3, those who are proficient with the relevant methods (practices) and create the necessary work products.

**The three areas of concern for the supersystems answer the corresponding questions**^[These questions were previously discussed in the subsection "Using Systems Approach and Systematicness".] when using a systems approach:

1. Area of concern for the supersystem: **why, for whom, and what should be done, and how will their behaviors change if offered something new?** Here, you need to hypothesize about which communities of people might enhance their lives due to what you propose—using a system that allows them to take on new roles and/or adopt new methods (including technologies). For example, Henry Ford offered the car to all adults, turning them into drivers to solve their spatial movement needs. Notably, not everything needs to be new—for instance, roles and disciplines might remain unchanged, while you offer just a new technology. For example, "SAP" for accountants who previously used Excel. In this area of interest, the primary objects of attention are: the group or community of people with their dissatisfactions, their roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed target system.
2. Area of concern for the target system: **what is this new entity from a product (system) standpoint, what are its characteristics, and how is it structured, what will it be made of?** Once hypotheses regarding the area of concern for the supersystem are posed and the role of the target system defined, you can move on to determining the system's design, including making architectural decisions. For instance, clocks for a space station, a person, and a tower will differ not only in materials but also in fundamental operational principles. Here, it will be necessary to estimate the total cost of ownership of the system and gauge its price for the buyer.
3. Area of concern for systems creation: **who and how will create the system, including what methods will be used, and with what resources?** Once the hypotheses about the system's design are accepted, we move on to its direct creation. Methods (practices) need to be determined through which it will be created. All creator roles must be allocated, and executors or performers (people, contractor organizations, tools, and AI) selected, while also acquiring other necessary resources. Moreover, it is essential to calculate the overall profitability of this endeavor.
