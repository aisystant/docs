title: System Decomposition

We have covered areas of interest, and now let's discuss systems decomposition and systems levels. **It's important not to confuse the concepts** of **"areas of interest"** (of systems and roles) and **"systems levels."**

As you already know, systems can be viewed from different perspectives:

* when a system acts as a whole for certain parts within it, implying the entire system consists of subsystems;
* when a system functions as a part of a supersystem, meaning the system itself is a subsystem.

Each subsystem is also a whole for its own sub-subsystems, and each supersystem is a part of a super-supersystem. Thus, we can talk about systems decomposition in a top-down or bottom-up manner. If we don't plan to further subdivide a particular system, we call it an **"element of a system,"** highlighting that there is a whole system somewhere for which this subsystem serves as an element.

The levels in systems decomposition are referred to as **systems levels.** These are identified using the part-whole relationship. This method helps us to logically distinguish these levels in the physical world. Of course, there are no physical boundaries or levels in reality; a systems thinker identifies them through their focus.

Classical systems decomposition by levels comes from biology. The diagram shows that cells are composed of molecules, yet the cells themselves are part of organs. Organs consist of cells, but organs themselves are parts of organisms. And so on. A person performing the role of a biologist chose to divide the world into parts this way, assigning names to these parts and levels^[Similarly, you'll need to find names for parts and systems levels in your work projects.].

The diagram shows systems levels—organism level, organ level, cell level, and the molecular systems level. However, the biosphere systems level is not shown as it is above the organism level, and the atomic systems level is absent as it is below the molecular level. This doesn't mean they don't exist; they simply aren’t represented in this diagram.

**Systems levels in your activities are also determined when necessary.** Primarily in project activities, a limited number of systems levels are used, and it's unlikely you'll consider more than 3–5 levels in your work. However, it is essential to acknowledge them, as interactions between levels (mismatches) occur continuously.

It's important to focus on other systems located at the same systems level. The attention must be sufficient to track systems in the environment and the physicality of part-whole relationships across several systems levels up and down. Working without concentrated attention or unconsciously drifting into mental spaces, or confusing what is part and what is whole, is hazardous for a project.

Once a systems level is established, we can proceed to discuss areas of interest. For example, in section 4, we identified areas of interest for the systems level "car," allowing us to discuss areas of interest for the supersystem (car+driver) and the creator. Similarly, areas of interest for the systems level "engine" or "piston" can be identified. Different teams work on different systems levels and with distinct areas of interest. When we need to construct a 3x3 Table for a specific system, such as a car, we must recognize that the table for a car differs from that for an engine or a piston, and thus, we require three distinct tables.

Note that **systems levels and areas of interest** do not completely overlap^[If you find this confusing, please consult the instructor. Without understanding this distinction, further study of the textbook will not be possible.]. These are different concepts applied to the selected system. In relation to this target system, areas of interest and systems levels are identified. For instance, if we take the "car" system, the area of interest for the supersystem will be linked to the "car+driver"^[Or " by the car," if creating a 3x3 Table for the "engine" or "by the engine," if creating one for the piston.]. The area of interest for the target system will relate to the "car"^[Or accordingly with the "engine" or the "piston."]. However, the creator's area of interest does not belong to the systems levels "supersystem – target system – subsystem."
