title: Project Activities and the Three Main Functional Roles
---

### Translation

In the previous section, we focused on the target system, with other systems serving as auxiliary. However, this does not mean that in project activities, we create or develop only it. Practically **in any activity** **or** **project, employees**^[This refers to people as agents or as role performers.] **may belong to teams of various** **subprojects** **and be creators of a wide variety of systems** (our systems and systems of creation). For example, Team #1 develops a car engine, while Team #2 works on enhancing the mastery of Team #1 members. Team #3 operates on the car assembly line, and Team #4 is engaged in creating and developing that assembly line. In all four teams, the automotive corporation's employees are involved, and the same person can be a member of several teams.

To understand the project or all teams and their subprojects within the extended enterprise, we need to:

* use a simplified meta-metamodel "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" to examine the project for creating the target system, which connects diverse roles and systems;
* introduce additional concepts of "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "systems levels."

The "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" (hereinafter referred to as the 3x3 Table) presented below illustrates the **connection of areas of interest for three main roles** (role subject areas) **and areas of interest for three main systems**. This tabular representation is a separate thinking technique that offers a way to segment an enterprise (organization) activity. In systems engineering, another approach will be suggested for viewing the creation and development of systems, as well as different role names for situations involving the enterprise, clientele, personality, etc.

In each system's area of interest, there are interests of all main roles â€“ entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These interests are backed by corresponding roles. The rows of the 3x3 Table represent areas of interest for three main systems, while the columns represent areas of interest for three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

Each cell of the 3x3 Table represents the **subject of interest** **of a particular role in a** **specific** **system**. That is, the role is interested in only what pertains to it within this system. For instance, an entrepreneur interested in the target system and everything related to it is called a visionary. The same logic applies to all other cells of the 3x3 Table.
