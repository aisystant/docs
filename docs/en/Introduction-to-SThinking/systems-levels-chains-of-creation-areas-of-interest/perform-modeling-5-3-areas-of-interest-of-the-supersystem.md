title: 'Perform Modeling: 5.3. Areas of Interest of the Supersystem'
---

Please review an example of a project description focused on three areas of interest. Describe three areas of interest for your business or project. Utilize the practice of thinking through writing, and for the first attempt, describe them as best you can. Afterwards, edit to leave only the most important details. You may also revisit the description over time. As the project develops, remember to update this description. It is useful for creating all other descriptions and for coordinating team efforts. Create notes for further development as needed. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes."

**Find the corresponding assignment by its number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
