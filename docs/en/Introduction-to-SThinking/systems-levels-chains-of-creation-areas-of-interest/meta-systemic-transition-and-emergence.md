title: Meta-System Transition and Emergence
---

The multi-level nature of systems decomposition is fundamental. At the highest level of any such decomposition, the universe is potentially present, while at the lowest are superstrings^[or other known physical objects of the smallest scale.]. However, the vast majority of people operate at the middle level, with peripheral levels being predominantly the domain of scientists.

For our activities, a small range of systems levels is important, which aligns with our life interests, although some might work at the level of humanity or the nano level. Most people will be interested in a few systems levels, similar to those concerning a car. In your case, it could be an IT program, a bridge, or mastery.

**Note: crossing a systems level changes everything****,** including the names of systems, roles, etc. Some roles are focused on using cars and discussing who will drive and where. Others concentrate on car parts and think about improving the efficiency of different components. A third group does not discuss cars at all but simply manufactures standardized parts. A fourth group will talk about the materials from which car parts are made. And so on. This is an interesting technique of systems thinking that helps in dealing with any complex subject-related activity.

All these roles utilize different methods and speak different languages: some roles primarily highlight the environment of cars and the challenges of their use, others focus on the production aspects of car creation and assembly, and yet others address issues like material strength, processing difficulty, and so forth.

When working with a car, terms like "movement, trip," etc., are regularly used, but the materials from which the car is made are not mentioned at all. If we narrow our focus by one systems level, we would be discussing the motor's efficiency. And what about one level down? Completely different people deal with materials: strength, friction, and everything else.

And all this gets reflected in the language of project roles that operate at each system level. Transitioning from discussing one systems level to another is known as a **meta-system** **transition**. For a systems thinker, the meta-system transition is literally audible in conversation and noticeable in the text! One of the techniques of systems thinking is the skill of maintaining focus in a conversation on the systems level being discussed. In professional communication, a discussion can touch upon multiple systems levels simultaneously.

The main aspect of communication among experienced specialists is not fluently juggling technical terms, but the fluidity of meta-system transition. **A professional thoroughly understands the emergent property** at each system level. For someone with systems thinking, the discussion is not just a simple flow of termsâ€”they literally hear or read concepts from different systems levels and understand the connection between different systems levels and areas of interest.
