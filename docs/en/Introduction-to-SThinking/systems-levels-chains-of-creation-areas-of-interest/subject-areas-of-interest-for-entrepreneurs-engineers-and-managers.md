title: The Subject Areas of Interest for an Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Manager
---

Let's take a closer look at the three subject areas of interest and discuss the interests of the three main roles: entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are so-called **activity roles**, which are widely recognized in culture (they are covered in textbooks and are relatively easy to identify) and through which other roles can be explained (they serve as a meta-model for other roles).

For instance, you may be well-versed in medicine and know many roles within the "doctors" category. An adult typically has a decent activity overview in medicine. However, if you aim to create successful systems and/or seek career growth, you also need to understand the roles and work products of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. The activity role of a doctor can also be explained through these three main roles. For example, the role of a dentist is an engineering role in the project of dental treatment, while a chief physician is a position where the individual is likely performing the role of a manager among other responsibilities.

The **three subject areas of interest** of these roles represent the minimum labor (activity) overview of a modern person. Whatever your position or roles, you need to have a general understanding of the interests of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager in a specific project or enterprise.

This overview is essential for everyone because **in some way, we all play the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager**, at least in personal projects. Whether deciding where to study or where to invest time, how to develop oneself or a child into an active individual, or how to manage resources, each person regularly answers these questions.

Let's revisit Table 3x3 and examine it through the lens of the three main roles. Note, for example, that a cook in the project of cooking borscht acts as an engineering role, but their subject area is not limited to the borscht system. It might include the presentation of the dish to the eater, the kitchen space, ingredients, utensils, and so on. Thus, an engineer is interested in not just the target system but also others. From this, we can outline general descriptions of subjects of interest, roles, and work products for each cell in the table.

The **entrepreneur** is interested in how to earn from addressing someone's dissatisfactions and doing so continuously (now and in the future). The class of "entrepreneurs" has specific interests and corresponding roles:

* Promoter (including educator, marketer, salesperson) — an entrepreneur interested in the external environment (market, opportunities) or supersystem, including clientele and their dissatisfactions;
* Visionary (strategist) — an entrepreneur interested in the demand (sales profitability) of a specific target system now and in the future;
* Businessman (founder) — an entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the target system.

The **engineer** is interested in a target system that should make the world a better place. The class of "engineers" has specific interests and corresponding roles:

* Product owner — an engineer interested in modeling and documenting usage scenarios of a target system within a supersystem;
* Target system engineer — an engineer interested in creating a successful target system (in a single instance), accounting for all stakeholders. Roles within the "engineers" class may include architects and developers;
* Development organizer (DevOps, development platform technologist, method manager) — an engineer interested in the functional capability of the enterprise (systems of creation) to produce the target system, including in required quantities.

The **manager** is interested in systems that must create target systems in the necessary quantity (not just one):

* Manager of external relations (PR, GR, and others) — a manager interested in accounting for external stakeholders in relation to the enterprise, including the enterprise's image, managing communications with various stakeholders such as investors and the public;
* Operations manager — a manager or work manager interested in the creation and delivery of the target system on time and within budget. They organize existing people to perform the corresponding roles in a pre-designed enterprise;
* Administrator — a manager interested in the operability and readiness for work of all enterprise systems, including qualified employees, necessary resources (working capital), and functional tools (technologies).

The **team’s workflow** can be explained as follows:

1. First, the entrepreneur identifies a group of potential clients and their problems (target group). They then determine how to solve these problems and designate a possible target system. They also find resources for organizing business activities;
2. Next, a systems engineer^[Roles include developer, architect, etc.] joins, identifying the needs of project roles and contemplating the arrangement of the target system, which should solve the problems of the target group of consumers identified by the entrepreneur;
3. Finally, the manager creates and manages the enterprise supposed to produce the necessary quantity of the target system to solve the target group's problems and informs all external project roles about how their interests are being taken into account.

Regardless of your role or position, it's desirable to understand the systems' interests and subject areas of the three main roles. It's essential to think about all this collectively and, as needed, separately, directing your attention accordingly.
