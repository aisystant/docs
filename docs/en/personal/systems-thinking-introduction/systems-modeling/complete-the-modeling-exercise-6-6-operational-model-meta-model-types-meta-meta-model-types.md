# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 6.6. Operational Model, Meta-Model Types, Meta-Meta-Model Types

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Note that the data provided may fit a wide range of situations; it is sufficient to describe any appropriate variant. The main thing is to avoid methodological mistakes.

Provide examples of chains in relation to meta-modeling for objects from your project, following the pattern in the first row. Do not worry too much about distinguishing between functional and structural objects and their types. What matters is that you differentiate between a real object from the physical world of the project, its type from the discipline in the project's subject area, and the discipline type from the intellect stack (from our textbook)â€”and, in addition to distinguishing them, also understand how they correspond to each other.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
