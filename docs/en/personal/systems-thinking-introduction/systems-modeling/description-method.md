# Description Method

You already know that a system description consists of role-based descriptions, which in turn are made up of models. To create a role-based description, you need a description method (practice). The description method is presented as a theory that explains how to create system descriptions and provides the necessary tools to produce a work artifact (documentation). The theory defines metamodels, which are then filled with data and thus become models. Models can exist on various media, such as paper or in a computer. In that case, we refer to documentation.

The simplest way to think about a description method, from a substantive perspective, is as a set of notations for multilayered map-models that describe a territory. The territory is the system, the map is the documentation with the system description, but there is also a method for creating the map^[For example, the photogrammetric method for creating topographic maps.], which includes metamodels, concepts, principles, and so on. The theory behind creating this description, along with the technology for making the map, constitutes the description method.

The universality of the top-level modeling approach means that the description is created in response to a specific subject of interest (or preference) regarding a particular system, and for this, the role(s) use a specific description method, which produces documentation addressed to another role. For example, a topological map is created in response to the interest “relief” of the system “territory” (a certain area). The map is created by topographers and used by surveyors, geologists, or geographers, and possibly by designers who are developing a building project.

A description method allows you to create descriptions of any systems. Of course, you should primarily focus on the system of interest, but in project work or within an enterprise, you will encounter many documents that describe a wide variety of systems (supersystems, subsystems, creation systems, etc.).

In the table above, you can see the relationship between the concepts of role, interest, role-based description, and description method. Note that you have probably seen similar role-based descriptions in the form of documents. Many of you are familiar with various description methods, which you use to create certain documents. Be sure to describe your roles, description methods, and work artifacts in the corresponding modeling exercise from the course.

Different roles may share the same interest, but their role-based descriptions can differ. A single role may have several interests. At the same time, you can create one description that addresses several subjects of interest.

It is important to choose the right description methods. For example, tax, financial, and managerial descriptions each require different methods. For tax purposes, you need tax and accounting methods; for financial descriptions, IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) or US GAAP; and for financial-managerial descriptions, there are management accounting methods. Note that all three descriptions (methods and work artifacts) are created for three different roles: the tax specialist, the shareholder, and the manager.

By now, you understand well that it is impossible to create high-quality role-based descriptions if the role-based description method and the corresponding documentation are not considered explicitly. In other words, you cannot do this unconsciously. Being mindful in applying the description method increases the likelihood that you will notice in time when you need to master a new method.
