# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 6.7. Functional and Constructive Descriptions

This is one example of describing the areas of interest for the system of interest.

Review the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the difference between the concepts of functional parts and product (modular) parts; if necessary, use the Aisystant AI bot. Fill in the empty cells after the example in the first row. If your perspective is too limited to come up with the necessary words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Provide five examples of different (as with scissors) functional and structural breakdowns of various systems.

Give examples from both work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
