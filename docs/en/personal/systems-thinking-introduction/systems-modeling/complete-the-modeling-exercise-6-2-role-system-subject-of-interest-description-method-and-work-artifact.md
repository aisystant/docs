# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 6.2. Role, System, Subject of Interest, Description Method, and Work Artifact

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. You may not always know the exact name of the description method, so instead, formulate its main characteristic (action). If necessary, use ChatGPT and Google for this purpose. As you progress through the course, it will be helpful to broaden your professional (activity-based) outlook—specifically, to learn the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts across a wide range of fields. Note that you may have a strong professional outlook in medicine, but you are likely less familiar with concepts in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. If needed, create notes for further review. You can also use the “Notes” section to leave feedback for the course developers.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
