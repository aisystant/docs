# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 4.1. Concepts

Write down the five (or more) concepts from this section that stood out to you the most, and next to each, indicate the concepts with which you most strongly associate them. The other concepts may come from your current worldview, so you do not have to list only the main concepts from this section. Discuss these concepts with your fellow students, colleagues, or close friends. For example, you can try to explain these concepts in simple terms, give examples from your own experience, connect different concepts to each other, or explain their importance.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
