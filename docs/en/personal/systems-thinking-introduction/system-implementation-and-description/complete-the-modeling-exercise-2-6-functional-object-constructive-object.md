# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 2.6. Functional Object, Constructive Object

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material, paying attention to the synonyms of the terms used in the table header. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the example. Provide at least two options (as shown in the example). If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. As needed, create notes for further review. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write down a question to ask in support chats or jot down a thought for future preparation.

Provide several examples from both work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
