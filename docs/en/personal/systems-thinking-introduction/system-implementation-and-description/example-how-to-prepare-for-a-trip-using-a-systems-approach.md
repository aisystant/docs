# Example: How to Prepare for a Trip Using a Systems Approach

I'm getting ready for another trip. I've decided to travel light, so I'm taking a small carry-on suitcase. There's no room for extra items, so I need to pack only the essentials. While choosing what to bring, I came up with a practical example: how to explain several systems thinking concepts.

What should you consider? We'll be talking about different types of objects—functional and physical.

You can look at an item or thing from a functional perspective, in which case its function is what matters. Or, you might focus on its physical characteristics, which means you need to see it as it exists in reality.

For this trip, I’ll need shorts and swim trunks. Usually, we don’t consciously think about what kinds of objects we’re dealing with. But even if we don’t distinguish between the concepts of “functional object” and “physical object,” it doesn’t stop us from making the right decision in this everyday example. However, when creating complex systems, separating these two concepts becomes extremely useful. This is at the heart of systems thinking.

Let’s start packing. “Shorts” and “swim trunks” at the packing stage are functional objects, not specific physical ones. Shorts and swim trunks serve different functions, and that’s the most important thing to understand during the design process.

Right now, I’m planning the trip and the necessary systems I’ll use during it. So I’m thinking about systems as functional objects: what I’ll need (functional objects) to make sure I have everything required and can perform different roles.

When I model the future, I first think about functional objects.

Let’s introduce some constraints. Because of the suitcase size, I decide I can only take one specific physical item (physical object) that will serve as either shorts or swim trunks, depending on the situation.

Not every item can fill both roles at once (a role is synonymous with a functional object). But, fortunately, I found just the thing: a pair of long blue swim shorts from Boss. They’ll perform the functions of both shorts and swim trunks. That’s what I’m taking on the trip. Now, in different situations, I’ll use a specific physical object—these long swim shorts.

Let’s look at how these concepts are structured. The items and things around us are named using the words commonly accepted in society. In culture, it’s often customary to name items after their main functional use.

We can say that things called “shorts” and “swim trunks” inherited their names from the functions of the corresponding functional objects. For example, shorts came from shortened pants, and an airplane, or a system designed to enable flight, is an object whose main function is to enable flight.

Let’s practice using systems thinking. A good system skill is to distinguish the context in which the words “shorts” and “swim trunks” are used. In every statement, you can track whether it’s about functional objects or specific physical instances (objects, things).

For example, consider these two statements: “I think I’ll need shorts for the trip” and “I’m taking these blue shorts with me.” Both sentences use the same word, “shorts,” but in the first, it’s a functional example, and in the second, it’s a physical one.

This skill, among many other system skills, will be especially useful when you work with systems in your professional projects.
