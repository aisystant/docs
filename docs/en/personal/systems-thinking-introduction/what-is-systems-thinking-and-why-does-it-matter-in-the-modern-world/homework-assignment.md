# Homework Assignment

**Q1.** Register and publish a draft in the AISYSTANT blog on one of the topics (concepts) from the section you have studied. For example, what you understood about systems thinking before starting the course, how you would explain this concept to others, what the intellect stack is and why it is needed.

**Q2.** Comment on 2 drafts from your fellow students in the blog, paying attention to how they model the world and which main concepts they use for this.

**Q3.** Recommendation for student practices for those who have not participated in long-term learning for a while: start studying the “Self-Development Practices” course at the same time.

**Q4.** Publish your answers to the “Questions for review, discussion, and thinking through writing” as a draft in the AISYSTANT club.

**Q5.** Record the amount of time invested in studying this section. Analyze how well you followed your time investment plan, paying particular attention to the regularity of your studies, any problems, and successes. Don’t hesitate to write down the results of your analysis.
