# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 1.6. Classic System Properties

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Note that the “System” column contains examples of ideal objects. Recall the difference between the classic systems approach 1.0 and systems approach 2.0, and in particular, what objective and subjective consideration of a system means.

Describe the properties of the systems listed in the table. You may also come up with your own examples. Highlight the classic properties of systems from your work and personal projects.

As needed, create notes for further review. For example, in the “Notes” column, write down your reflections or a question you might later ask in support chats.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
