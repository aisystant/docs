# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.3. Role, Role Performer, Title, and Position

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the differences between the concepts of “role” and “position,” “rank” and “qualification.” Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Recall the full names of well-known individuals who fit these descriptions. If your knowledge is insufficient to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts. Describe your colleagues from both professional and personal projects.

As needed, make notes when filling out the table templates again. You may record your reflections and the results of your error analysis.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
