# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

With the concept of "role," humanity is better able to describe the physical world and model human activities. "Role" is connected to action, while an agent is the executor/performer of a role. After that, one can separately discuss the mastery and qualifications of the executor/performer, as well as independently address and improve the role-based actions required within a team.

One could say that "role" is a model of thinking that helps study and improve the behavior of the agent. Thanks to the concepts of "role," "subject of interest," and "role interests" (preferences), a successful system can be defined.

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions regardless of who is currently performing the role. This knowledge, together with tools, is what we call a method (practice). Using specific methods (practices), roles create work artifacts.

Key concepts: executor/performer of a role, agent, role = role-based object = functional object, project roles; method, practice, work artifact; successful system; subject of interest, role interest, architectural characteristics, preference; intention; physical object = executor/performer, functional object = role, role-based behavior = functional behavior; black box and transparent box; position, qualification, title; organization, organizational positions = roles, organizational unit.
