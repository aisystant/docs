# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.2. Role and Role Performer

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Note that the project name uses the names of the system and the main method. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the example. Write the full names of people you know who perform these roles. If your knowledge is not broad enough to select the appropriate words and designations (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with acquaintances who are experts.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. If necessary, create notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a question related to your project.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
