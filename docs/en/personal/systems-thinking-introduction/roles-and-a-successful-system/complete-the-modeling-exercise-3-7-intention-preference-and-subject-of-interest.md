# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.7. Intention, Preference, and Subject of Interest

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material on the differences between the concepts of “subject of interest,” “preference,” and “intention.” Which of these concepts relate to the role, and which to the executor/performer of the role? Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the example. Keep in mind that a project role can be either external or internal to the system.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. It is sufficient to give one example per cell.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
