# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.5. Roles Performed by a Manager

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Write down at least three roles that you know your supervisor has performed over the past few months (if possible, arrange them in chronological order). Don’t forget about roles such as “strategist,” “leader,” “organizer,” and other managerial and entrepreneurial roles, as well as roles of organizational engineers (unlike technical engineers, organizational engineers often don’t consider this work, but in reality, it is work—it requires mastery and significant investments of time and other resources). If you lack the perspective to find the right words and titles (names), use ChatGPT, Google, or consult with knowledgeable experts.

Write down the roles you perform as a manager in your work or personal project. If you think you are not a supervisor anywhere, that is a mistake. If necessary, use thinking through writing to reflect on this question.
