# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.9. The Work of an Analyst

Recall the difference between an analyst and an engineer. Enter the percentage of time you spend on analytical work, and the percentage of time you spend on engineering work:

* doing something that does not lead to your decisions being accepted by others without further questions—that is, creating internal work artifacts;
* changing the surrounding world with your decisions, where everyone understands these are your decisions, your responsibility, and does not interfere with them—that is, creating external work artifacts.

Record these numbers in the table: ideally, extract these figures from your Pomodoro exocortex. You may separate work and personal projects if you wish.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
