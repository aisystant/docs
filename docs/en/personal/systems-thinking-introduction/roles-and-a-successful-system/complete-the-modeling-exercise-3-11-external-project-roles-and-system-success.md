# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success

List at least 15 external roles of different people involved in your current project, along with their interests. Remember that one person may play several roles, so try to list all the roles for each individual. Indicate your expectation (on a ten-point scale) regarding the fulfillment of their preferences as a result of the project’s implementation. If necessary, make notes for further follow-up. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat or jot down a thought for a future draft.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
