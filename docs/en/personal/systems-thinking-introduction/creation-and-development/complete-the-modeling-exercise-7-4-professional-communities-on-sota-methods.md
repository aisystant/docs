# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.4. Professional Communities on SOTA Methods

Review the examples. List the professional communities in which you participate (or have participated). If necessary, create notes for further development. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can write down an idea for the future that comes to mind. By recording it right away, you increase your chances of implementing it later.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its tasks.
