# Conclusions of the Section and Main Concepts

The creation and development of systems are considered in relation to different systems. In any project activity, multiple systems are created and developed at various system levels and along different creation chains. At a minimum, this involves the creation and development of the system of interest and the creation systems.

Systems thinking defines important objects of focus for any activity. We start with the area of interest of the supersystemâ€”that is, we look at the world we want to change in some way. Then we move on to the system of interest and its structure. After that, we discuss the system-creator, including creation methods, roles, and resources.

The techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system through concepts such as organizational role, organizational unit, method, work, service, and others.

Systems thinking can be viewed as one way to identify the necessary work artifacts. The techniques of systems thinking make it possible to determine the required work artifacts based on system modeling, as described in the 3x3 Table. This serves as a kind of checklist to ensure nothing is overlooked during the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

Key concepts: practice, method, organizational role, work artifact, discipline, tool, work management, method management, method manager, enterprise architect, stages, phases, organization, organizational unit, service, principle of continuity, iteration, increment, functional description of the enterprise system, modular description of the enterprise system.
