# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.2. Method: Discipline and Tools

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Note that your activities involve several methods, and each method can be implemented using different tools.

Provide examples from both work and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks that you performed at your job and spent more than two hours per day on. In which role did you do this, what methods did you use, and where are these methods described? Also indicate the best of the alternative methods (the one you considered but rejected when choosing how to carry out the workâ€”the best of the discarded options).

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
