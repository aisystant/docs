# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery

Evaluate, on a ten-point scale, how much thinking mastery you gained at university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you received at AISYSTANT. The total for each transdiscipline cannot exceed 10 points (across university, self-study, and AISYSTANT).

It's okay if you don't fully understand the content of all the listed transdisciplines in the intellect stack—try to make an educated guess based on the brief descriptions provided in our course.

Indicate the year in which your knowledge would have been considered SoTA (for example, if you last studied physics in 1980, then that year cannot be more recent than 1980).

Your assessment of your current thinking mastery can take forgetting curves into account. If you excelled in a discipline in 2010 and would have rated yourself 10 points back then, but haven't refreshed your mastery in that discipline since—how many points would you give yourself now?

In the end, calculate the average value of your thinking mastery level.

If necessary, make notes for further review. For example, in the “Notes” column, you can record your reflections on what came to mind while filling out the table. This will help you approach the formation of your personal educational trajectory more consciously.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
