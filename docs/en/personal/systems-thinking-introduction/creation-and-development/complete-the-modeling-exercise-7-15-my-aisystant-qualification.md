# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 7.15. My Aisystant Qualification

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. In the “Life Mastery” column, rate your current level of life mastery on a 10-point scale. Life mastery is calculated as the average of your thinking mastery and applied mastery scores. The thinking mastery score is determined as the average from the “Level of Thinking Mastery” table, while the applied mastery score is the average from the “My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects” table.

Mark your current AISYSTANT qualification and the year you obtained it. Also, indicate the years you received previous qualifications to assess your progress. In the column “What needs to be done to obtain the next qualification,” describe your plans for self-development.

Please note that unused knowledge is forgotten, so it is important to regularly confirm your qualification. It is not necessary to do this within AISYSTANT, but we would be glad if you share the results of your work and personal projects on AISYSTANT’s public platforms. This will be sufficient for updating and awarding a new qualification.

The highest qualification, “constructor,” means that you are able to find new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that make the world a better place, and live a happy, successful, and interesting life.
