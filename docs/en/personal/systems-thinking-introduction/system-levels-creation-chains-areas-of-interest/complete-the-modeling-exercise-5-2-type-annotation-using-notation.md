# Complete the Modeling Exercise: 5.2. Type Annotation Using Notation ::

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Use the most convenient type-marking format in the textâ€”the double colon "::". First, write the name of the object, then its type from the meta-model (or, additionally, from the meta-meta-model). For example: "an airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object". If necessary, review the theoretical material on the :: notation in the "Rational Work" course.

For the sentences in the table, create a duplicate, specifying the types of all objects and relationships as shown in the first row. Fill in the empty cells and write several examples from your work and personal projects.

Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its steps.
