# Systems Approach 3.0

In the first generation of systems thinking, systems were considered “objective” rather than subjective—that is, the perspectives of numerous stakeholders were not taken into account. For example, a chair, a hammer, or a car are all systems that everyone understands; they have a clear purpose (role and function), and only this purpose was considered. This clarity made it possible to formally model only the most important aspects of systems^[Without giving due attention to the large number of other interests and interactions.], which is why first-generation systems thinking textbooks are full of formulas, numbers, and so on.

At the end of the last century and in the 2010s, the second generation of systems thinking became dominant. It differed from its predecessor in that it viewed systems as subjective rather than objective. Numerous stakeholders appeared, along with the understanding that systems do not exist on their own but arise when someone needs them. Recall how, earlier in Section 2, we discussed the “hammer” system and how it differs from the physical object called a “hammer.” In addition, in the first generation, systems seemed to come into being on their own, while in the second generation, they are created by people.

In the 2020s, a significant number of works began to emerge that can be attributed to the third generation of systems thinking. Our intellect stack also draws on these modern trends and develops them further. The main principles of the third generation are:

* Scalelessness: applying the same approach and reasoning to objects of any scale, from tiny details to entire systems, or from superstrings to the universe;
* De-anthropomorphism: not placing humans at the center, so we talk about agents with varying degrees of consciousness, different types of memory and modeling abilities, and diverse computational capacities for planning actions;
* Multi-level evolution: considering not only genes but also memes, as well as overcoming numerous problems and misalignments between system levels, and moving toward ethics in decision-making;
* Continuous development^[This is especially relevant in systems engineering and is covered in more detail in the corresponding course. This principle includes advanced generative modeling, good documentation, configuration management, and system modularity. Development occurs incrementally, with small and rapid changes to adapt to constantly changing conditions. The main goal of continuous development is long-term success and maintaining achieved results.]: the development of a system (product) never ends and continues constantly, taking into account changes in the surroundings at different system levels and problems that arise during development (including within the development organization).

In the third generation of the systems approach, we consider a scaleless world of systems, not a “world of people,” and these systems are in a state of continuous development and always in process. In this process of development (and sometimes destruction), misalignments (frustrations) between system levels come into play, and conflicts occur between all levels (both system levels and creation chains).

Systems at different system levels try to maintain stability and develop, but this often conflicts with the desires for stability and development of systems at the same or other system levels. For example, countries may go to war with each other or fall apart internally due to disagreements at the level of individual communities and interest groups. Also, during evolution, meta-system transitions frequently occur, and this happens because of inevitable misalignments between system levels. As a result, only certain system configurations survive—those that most effectively solve the problem of multi-level (not just single-level!) optimization.

It is important to note that these third-generation systems approach principles can be discussed using the concepts introduced in this section. For example, it is impossible to consider only one system level^[This can lead to a fatal mistake.]; you have to think about and, if necessary, cooperate with other teams working at other system levels. Successful systems are those in which the satisfaction of interests (optimization of conflicts and misalignments) occurs simultaneously across different levels—even those we may not be aware of. At the very least, you should always try to identify all misalignments.

You will study the third generation of systems thinking in more detail in the “Systems Thinking” course.
