title: Examples of system descriptions as a transparent box
---

Let's consider three descriptions using the example of a clock^[Image by A. Turhanov.].

**Functional description** — this is the description of subsystems as role-based or functional objects. A functional description shows "how the system works inside." For example, in the functional diagram, it shows how the clock works. Note that there are no modules in this diagram because the functional parts of the clock are important here. These parts show us their functional or role behavior.

**Constructive or physical modules** — these are the objects assembled into the clock system. A modular description or modular breakdown shows what the system is assembled from. As you can see, the modular diagram indicates many constructive parts of the system. The principle of the clock's operation is not clear here, but it's clear how to assemble the clock from gears, springs, hands, and other modules.

The third description is **the description of spatial locations** where the parts of the system are placed. That is, it's important to know where in the universe the parts of the system are located. This is a spatial breakdown. Without knowing the exact placement of the modules, the system won't work.

**Systems levels are determined by functional** **breakdown ---the main of systems thinking**! Therefore, functional breakdown is often called systemic. What about the others? These are usual breakdowns. And, of course, it's important not to forget that there are modular and spatial breakdowns.

As you can see, all systems at each system level interact with each other as functional objects. This interaction is described by a functional diagram. At the same system level, specific physical objects that perform these functions (or play the role of functional objects) can be identified. These physical objects are located somewhere in space. If we move to another system level, everything will be exactly the same there.

For example, we can identify functional, physical objects and their places at the subsystem level of the motor. Then we can identify functional, physical objects and their placements at the level of the entire car. Here, we will no longer consider the motor's structure; it will be part of the car system. Moreover, the system-motor can be viewed from a functional perspective — this functional object should deliver torque^[Usually, the functional object of the motor system in culture is called an engine. This is a role, the function of which is to move. Internal combustion engines move via torque transmitted to the chassis.]. The system-motor can also be viewed as a physical object — this would be the gasoline engine BD-1324. We can ascend another level higher, where there will be different functional, physical objects and their placements.

The next example is related to the **human-actor system**, which can create successful systems in various projects. An actor has functional behavior — life skills. Life skills consist of the following functional parts:

-   thinking skills or intellect;
-   applied skills.

Another example concerns the functional parts of the car system, which are the chassis, body, and engine. Here, further functional breakdown can also be done, and the chassis's structure can be examined, allowing for the identification of the next system level.
