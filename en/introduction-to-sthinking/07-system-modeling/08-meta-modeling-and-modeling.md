title: Meta-modeling and Modeling
---

In our textbook, **meta-meta-models** are defined. For example, the concept of "system" is a meta-meta-model. Such abstract concepts are studied primarily in transdisciplines. Then you descend into the subject area, where there are **meta-models**. For example, the system of interest in education is the concept of mastery, and in the transportation industry, it's a vehicle. It can be specified as mastery of accounting (or mastery of organization) and passenger car, respectively.

Next, we create a **model** — the description of Ivan's mastery or the model of a BMW X6 car. Ivan's actual mastery (not the concept) or the actual BMW X6 car is already the **system** itself (a physical object). It is also referred to as a system of interest (a term from the meta-meta-model).

Such concepts are used not only in systems thinking. Our language is structured in the same way. For example, we can say that the concept "mother" is a meta-meta-model. The concept "mother" is a meta-meta-model to identify a living being that has children.

In a zoo, the concept "mother of cub" is used - this is a meta-model from the subject area of the animal world (not human). A meta-model might also be "mother of tiger cubs."

An entry in the zoo database — "tigress Maya, mother of tiger cub Murzik" — is a model. A photograph of tigress Maya or a sculpture of tigress Maya is also a model.

The tigress Maya, who became a mother, is a physical 4D-object in the zoo. Tigress Maya is the "mother of cub" and "mother." But not all "mothers" are "mothers of cub," and not all "mothers of cub" are tigress Maya.

All this is covered in the course "Rational Work" and is further used in systems thinking. You can already differentiate systems and processes, roles and performers, models and meta-models, etc. For better training in systems thinking, it is recommended to use our course as a simulator (engage in modeling), which helps to develop skills and get used to modeling^[Systems thinking in terms of form is expressed as "thinking by writing" or "thinking by modeling." Modeling tasks or filling in tables in the course are the next step towards establishing systems thinking (after studying systems concepts).].

We previously mentioned that establishing systems thinking begins with studying systems concepts^[Including understanding their interconnections.]. Now **you are more consciously paying attention** to **modeling techniques, and later you will engage in meta-modeling**. Meta-modeling is the creation of table templates, i.e., defining the names of rows and/or columns of a table (the properties of a table). This work was done by the course developers to create universal tables, and as development directors, you will create similar tables for your employees for your work projects^[Some tables you will take from the course, but you may also create your unique tables with applications area concepts.]. For now, you are engaged in modeling, which means filling in course tables^[Beautiful diagrams of squares and arrows are a popular understanding of systems modeling. Tables and even texts are more adequate and systematic for complex projects and systems.]. But for this, you need to know the subject area since the tables reflect specific work activities and use applied method concepts.

Thus, to establish systems thinking, it is necessary to study the systems language, modeling, and meta-modeling. We recommend doing this by thinking with writing and working with tables, not diagrams: fill in and create tables for your work projects. Therefore, **use your work time for modeling and meta-modeling,** because you can't learn to drive a car on a training ground - that's why students are almost immediately sent onto city roads. Therefore, use the modeling tool (Coda or at least our course as a simulator) immediately in your work conditions.
