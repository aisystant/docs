title: 'Perform Modeling: 6.2. Role, system, system of interest, method of description, and work artifact'
---

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. You may not always know the exact name of the description method, so formulate its main feature (action). If necessary, use ChatGPT and Google for this. Throughout the course, it will be useful for you to expand your work (activity) horizon, specifically to learn the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts in various fields of activity. Note that you have a good activity horizon in medicine but may have less knowledge of terms in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. Formulate notes for further development if necessary. You can also leave feedback in the "Notes" for the course developers.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
