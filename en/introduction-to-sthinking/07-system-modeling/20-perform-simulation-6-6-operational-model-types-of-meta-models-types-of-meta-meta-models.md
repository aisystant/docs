Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the example. Note that the provided data may fit a large number of different situations, you only need to describe any variant. The main thing is to avoid methodological errors.

Provide examples of chains related to meta-modeling for objects from your project, following the pattern in the first row. Do not worry too much about distinguishing between functional and constructive objects and their types. It is important that you distinguish the real object from the physical world of the project, its type from the discipline in the project's subject area, and the type of discipline from the intelligence stack (from our textbook)â€”and in addition to distinguishing, understand their correspondence.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
