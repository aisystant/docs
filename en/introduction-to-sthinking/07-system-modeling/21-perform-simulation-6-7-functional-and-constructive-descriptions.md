title: 'Perform Simulation: 6.7. Functional and Constructive Descriptions'
---

This is one of the examples of descriptions of the system of interest.

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. It is recommended to revisit the theoretical material to understand the difference between the concepts of the functional part and product (modular) parts. Use the AI-bot Aisystant if necessary. Fill in the empty cells after the example in the first row. If you lack the perspective to choose the right words and notations (names), use ChatGPT or Google for assistance. Provide five examples of different (like scissors) functional and constructive breakdowns of some systems.

Provide examples from work and personal projects.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
