title: How to Think About Systems?
---

**The goal of this section** **is** to understand how to think about systems and comprehend how systems modeling occurs.

Thinking about systems means modeling them â€” that is, describing and documenting them. Systems modeling is a **process of creating** **system definitions** that help understand and explain complexity and structure within the system, as well as its interaction with the external environment.

Before creating a system, it is necessary to create its definition, or more precisely, a **work artifact with this definition, that is, documentation**. Embodying the system is much more expensive than providing documentation with the definition, which is why in the modern world, greater attention is given to modeling the system as the "black" and "transparent" boxes.

Modeling in systems thinking is the primary tool for tackling complexity. Complexity also lies in the fact that in a project and at an enterprise, you deal with several systems, each of which needs to be described as "black" and "transparent" boxes. **Therefore, you will have to** **create multiple definitions for various systems and areas of interest**^[In our course and in the second semester of the main program, you mainly deal with a universal approach to modeling any system, and in the third semester, you focus on documenting all systems involved in the project.]. Not only the system of interest is described, but also the super-system areas of interest and creating systems, and it often requires describing our system and systems within creation chains.

All this would be challenging if not for the **universality of the approach** to such definitions. In this section, we will explore the concepts that will allow you to create systems definitions while being part of a team of systems specialists. For this purpose:

1. We will study approaches to **defining any system** as "black" and "transparent" boxes;
2. We will understand specific types of definitions for different areas of interest in **project activities**.
