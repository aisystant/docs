title: Example of Description of the Superystem's Area of Interest
---

Let's consider an example of one of the descriptions of cell 1.1 of the 3x3 table.

In marketing, concepts such as **problems** **or customer
dissatisfactions** (target audience) are often discussed. These are important concepts in business activity, but it is necessary to understand how they relate to such systemic concepts in the area of interest of the supersystem as opportunities, needs, and external project roles.

For example, a marketer identifies a **group of people** **or agents**
(such as companies) who can potentially play external project roles associated with clientele (buyer, user, payer, etc.). This group of people or agents is called the target audience or target group. There are applied marketing practices^[These practices analyze the characteristics of the target audience and create a customer profile. But we will not discuss such applied practices in the course.], that allow describing potential representatives of the target audience. For example, they describe their problems and dissatisfactions, compile a customer profile.

Sometimes, there is talk about needs included in Maslow's hierarchy. At the same time, one should not confuse the same word "need" in the context of Maslow's theory^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs){target="_blank"}] and in the context of systems thinking: the former refers to the agent, and the latter to the project role. Further, we will name Maslow's need as an **agent's dissatisfaction** (or problem), and use the term "need" only when referring to **the needs of external project roles** (not the agent).

Characteristics such as age, gender^[Although modern marketing theories do not recommend focusing on such characteristics, rather prioritizing agents' behavioral factors.], place of residence, social status, competencies and education, available resources (time per week, finances), etc. are used to describe agents. These characteristics are necessary to understand the "intent" of these people. And the main task of marketing is to ensure that people from the target audience assume the role of the buyer, and then the role of the user.

Therefore, it is necessary to separately analyze:

- **dissatisfactions and problems** of people from the target audience^[With specific people as representatives of the target audience. People's dissatisfactions are described not only in Maslow's hierarchy. Here are a few more sources: [https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory){target="_blank"}, [https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/](https://baynvc.org/list-of-needs/){target="_blank"}. And note, there is no pyramid there.];
- **needs of external project roles** played by people from this target audience.

Problems and dissatisfactions place (compel, stimulate) people into certain project roles, and when they begin to act according to these project roles, they have corresponding needs. In other roles, these same people may have completely different needs.

This example once again demonstrates that it is necessary to carefully consider the concepts from different theories, and that systems thinking helps quickly understand these concepts and connect them with each other.
