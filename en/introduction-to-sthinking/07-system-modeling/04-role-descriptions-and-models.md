title: Role Descriptions and Models
---

In the first section of the course, it was mentioned that a system has certain classical properties and depends on design roles. We later found out that there are numerous subjects of interest in the system, and each **description is made for a specific subject of interest**.

In the adapted scheme from the **ISO 42010 standard**^[Read more about this standard in the "System Thinking" textbook.] you can see how to reason about system interests, design roles, role descriptions, models, etc. This international standard provides recommendations on how to think about the system definition.

The standard itself only speaks about architectural description, but its provisions can be applied to any descriptions of different systems. For example, to apply this scheme not to the system of interest, but to the creating systems.

In life, it usually starts with identifying the role type of description that stems from a certain interest. For example, an enterprise has a **subject of interest - taxes**. There are certain design roles (with their methods and work artifacts) that have this subject of interest. However, the preferences in this subject of interest may not coincide for a tax inspector, manager, and accountant.

To address this subject of interest, a tax description is formed that should include all preferences of the design roles. Each design role desires something different, but to agree, it is necessary to create a common description for all interested^[Meaning those who have the same subject of interest.] design roles.

It consists of certain models. It is easy to discuss tax matters because many **metamodels** are set by the state in relevant regulatory documents. These are documents like "Balance Sheet", "Profit and Loss Statement", and others. And when these metamodels are filled with corresponding report data, they become models â€” descriptions of a specific enterprise and its economic activities.

As you might have guessed, there is a specific **description method** used to compose this tax description. It is the method of accounting and tax accounting.

The state is concerned with taxes, therefore it promotes its subject of interest through the normative approval of description methods (metamodels) and meticulously reads the models presented by accountants. Take an example from tax inspectors on how to pay attention to modeling.

However, on the other hand, you must not forget for a second that in the end, you need **embodiment of the system**, and the description given to us in the form of models, drawings, manufacturing instructions, etc., is necessary only because without description, it is very difficult to bring a working system to life.
