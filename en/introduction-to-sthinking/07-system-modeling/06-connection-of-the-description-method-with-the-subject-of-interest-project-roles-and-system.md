title: Connection of the description method with the subject of interest, project roles, and system
---

In previous sections, it was mentioned that the **subject of interest** is connected to the system. The **system** can be characterized by different subjects of interest. Subjects of interest are related to **project roles**, meaning people in roles are interested in certain characteristics of the system.

The **team** determines which interests of the project roles^[From all considered project roles, subjects of interest and/or preferences that will be accommodated are selected. It is impossible to satisfy all interests, as resources (means and time) might be insufficient, but on the other hand, the team must not make a fatal mistake. A fatal mistake might be that the team neglected some interest, which will later cause significant and irreparable costs.] will be satisfied when creating the system. Accordingly, it depends on what **work artifacts** (**documentation**) will be needed. Work artifacts are physical carriers that contain a description of the system, responding to a specific subject of interest.

To create documentation, one needs to possess a certain practice^[As you recall, the project role creates a work artifact by practice.] or method of description. Through this **method** of **description**, a description of the system is created on a physical carrier, responding to the subject of interest to the system.

For example, a racer's interest is in the speed of the race car. The same can be stated differently: the external project role "racer" has the subject of interest "speed" to the system "race car". Developers decided to satisfy the racer's interests, meaning the team considered that the interests of this project role should be satisfied. This means that further work will continue with this subject of interest, within which documentation (a computer model) will be created.

Then developers choose the description method to make a description of the system. They choose one of the description methods that allows building a computer model for calculating the car's speed^[Here, both the theoretical part of calculations and the computer part of how these calculations can be carried out are important.]. This model in the computer is a work artifact that contains a description of the car system on the subject of interest, speed.

Incidentally, this model may consider not only this subject of interest but others as well. The total number of work artifacts (documentation) based on system descriptions is proportional to the number of subjects of interest, and the **number of subjects of interest is proportional to the number of project roles** decided to satisfy^[As you recall, all project roles are considered, but the team may decide that only selected ones will be satisfied. For each of them, a work artifact is created to satisfy the project role. The scheme shows only the external project role, but the same applies to the internal project role.].
