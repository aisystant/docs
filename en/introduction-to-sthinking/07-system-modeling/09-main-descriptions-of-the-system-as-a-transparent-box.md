title: Main Descriptions of the System as a “Transparent Box”
---

In systems modeling, we always begin work with the **area of interest of the supersystem**^[One of the skills of systems thinking: the first step of attention is always outward from the boundary of the system of interest, and the second step is inward into the system.] — define external design roles, their needs, and areas of interest. Only then do we move on to the structure of the system of interest, which we discuss in this subsection. In the next section 7, you will learn about the features of creating systems modeling.

The system of interest is viewed as a "black box" and a "transparent box."

A system as a black box is described through role behavior and function, areas of interest, capabilities (needs), and external design roles. **System as a “black box”** is described either as future^[That is, designing/designing as part of modeling what kind of system is needed as part of the supersystem. This is direct engineering.] or as existing^[Or reverse engineering, i.e., describing an already working system if such a description is unavailable but necessary for something. This is "reverse engineering."], but in both cases, attention must be paid to the following descriptions of the system:

-   as a functional/role object and its behavior in interaction with the environment at the time of operation;
-   as a structural object represented in the physical world and occupying space at the time of operation;
-   as the total cost of ownership of the system.

Note that based on these descriptions of the system as a "black box," the description of the system as a "transparent box" follows. The internal description is an integral consequence of the external. For example, in section 3, we already discussed the role of an architect, who determines the structural (modular) structure of the system based on the architectural areas of interest of the system.

In this subsection, **we will talk about** **how to describe** **the internal structure of the system** **(“transparent box”).** Conditional "splitting" of the system into parts can be done in different ways^[If different people look at a cat, they will see differently. A veterinarian will see the biological structure of a kitten, and a grandmother—a warm and fluffy object. The system can be divided by the materials used (iron, plastic, glass, etc.) or by the color of parts (black, white, or colored) or the shape of parts (round, square, etc.).]. Here are four main types of splitting the system into parts and the corresponding descriptions using the example of a "kettle" system:

-   someone is interested in the functions of parts during operation and says that the teapot consists of a container, a spout, a pouring hole in the container, a handle on the container, a lid, a handle on the lid, and also a steam release hole in the lid, otherwise water will splash out from the spout when closing the wet lid. This is called the **functional description** of the kettle system, and the description of subsystems as role (functional) objects is called **system division.**
-   another says that the teapot consists of only two parts in the construction of the teapot, which need to be made, as his interests lie in the time of manufacturing the teapot. Here the area of interest is in the construction, namely in "what to produce" or "how to assemble." This is a **modular (product) description of the system.**
-   the third says that the lid and kettle should be stored nearby, and it would be better if the lid was directly on the kettle. This is interest in placement, i.e., "where in the universe are the parts of the kettle." This is a **description of places, placements (spatial description)** of parts within the system.
-   the fourth talks about the cost of teapot parts, i.e., on what money and other resources will be required to spend. This is **cost description**, which is part of the full ownership description of the system as a “black box.”

Systems thinking provides for multiple descriptions of the system. But four main types of description or viewpoints on dividing the system into parts stand out^[For example, in recent times, an additional area of interest has been highlighted on the kind of work done with parts of the system.]. The main decisions on the system's structure are called the **concept of the system.** Usually, the concept of the system is not created once; it gradually acquires details until the precision of the system description is sufficient for its production on a production platform. That is, the concept of the system is "alive," it changes during development, and the system is constantly modified even after the start of its operation.

To compose each of these system descriptions, it is necessary to know a specific practice or **method of description.** Through this method, a specific work artifact is obtained. For example, earlier, an example was given that according to the description method of management accounting, it is possible to obtain a financial description of the enterprise system that interests the manager.

Note that all these descriptions do not coincide with each other. Particularly **it is difficult to notice the discrepancy between functional and modular descriptions.** Usually, developers determine the main function of the system and consider the system as a functional object consisting of functional subsystems. The architect, in turn, defines which structural modules (executors) will play these roles. At the same time, the coincidence of functional and modular parts does not necessarily have to be 1 to 1, and the names of these parts may differ. Look at the example with scissors, where the functional parts are the blade block and the handle, and the modular parts are half 1 and half 2.

In systems projects, there is functional analysis, i.e., division into parts (analysis is division), and modular synthesis, i.e., assembly. Be wary of projects where it is unclear who makes decisions regarding synthesis. In such projects, analysts usually work, but they do not change the world. Synthesis and synthesis decisions change the world!

Thus, a person with a systems approach is capable of considering the structure of any system as a "transparent box," highlighting at least four areas of interest:

-   functional=role=analytical^[Usually analysis or division into parts is done to understand the principle of the system's structure. That is, analysis helps to understand the functional parts of the system. And synthesis or assembly is associated with the procedure of assembling a system from physical models. Therefore, they often talk about functional analysis and modular synthesis. It is necessary to conduct both analysis and synthesis. You cannot engage only in one.];
-   modular=structural=synthetic;
-   spatial=places=placements;
-   cost=economic=resource.
