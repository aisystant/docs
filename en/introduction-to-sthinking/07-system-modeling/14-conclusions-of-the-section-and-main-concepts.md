Systems modeling is the **process of creating** **descriptions**
of a **system** that help understand and explain the complexity and structure
within the system, as well as the system's interaction with the external environment.
Modeling involves describing only the essential aspects and omitting
the unimportant. Documenting models allows the entire team to focus on the important, while the unimportant does not retain attention and remains 
only in conversations.

Role descriptions, which collectively form the **system definition,** are created through a **description method**. Most of you are involved in modeling and documentation creation for various systems.
Therefore, it is important to understand the description methods you use.
It is necessary to improve in them, which is applied craftsmanship.
Nevertheless, systems thinking, in particular, will help focus on these
methods and integrate them, if necessary, into the project activities of your
department or entire company.

There can be many system descriptions, and it is possible to describe a system as
a **"black"** and as a **"transparent" box**. One of the important descriptions
of the external behavior of the system is the concept of use. Speaking of
the internal structure of the system, we highlight 4 main descriptions:
functional, modular, spatial (placement), and financial (resource).

We refer to **upper-level** **modeling** in project activities 
as the designation of all important systems and subsystems, as well as understanding
their interconnections. In each cell of the 3x3 Table, specific
documents with descriptions on different areas of interest can be identified.

**Key Concepts:** system definition; modeling, description method,
system of interest; model, metamodel, multimodel, mega-model;
functional=role-based=analytical;
modular=constructive=synthetic;
spatial=places=placement; cost=economic=resource;
functional description, modular description, spatial description.
