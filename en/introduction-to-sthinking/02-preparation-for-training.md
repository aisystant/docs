title: Preparation for Training
---

Before starting the course learning project, take 30 minutes to organize your work for the first week. After testing, you can make changes for the second and subsequent weeks.

This task is especially important for those who haven't undergone long-term training for a while. Treat studying the course as regular training for your brain, during which your thinking will be reprogrammed. Therefore, pay close attention to the tasks, and it is advisable to describe your thoughts (hypotheses) about each task in a few words, as this will help you start thinking in writing. For example, you might respond to completing the second task like this: “I want to study the course in the morning before work for 30 minutes, then allocate 1 hour during the day, and another 30 minutes in the evening. To do this, I will start shifting my evening awake time to morning study time: begin going to bed 15 minutes earlier in the evening, and when waking up earlier, start studying at least for 15 minutes a day and extend this time to 30 minutes.”

1. Describe your expectations from the course. You can list professional and personal issues, as well as what you'd like to improve in yourself. By completing this task in writing, you will increase the chances of successfully finishing the course, and it will also be useful for you to compare your expectations throughout the course and during the preparation for the defense at the end of the course.
2. Change your daily schedule to include studying the course. Find 1-2 hours to attend the course each day during the first week of training, literally marking this time in your personal calendar. Write your hypothesis as per the example above. Revisit it in a week and add a correction to this initial hypothesis below.
3. Choose a time-tracking tracker dedicated to course attendance (preferably 2--4 Pomodoros a day for 25--30 minutes each). For instance, the Focus To Do smartphone app has a SHSM group you can join with the code: JNSYL. Create a “My Learning” project in the tracker. Start using the ritual of enabling the tracker: at the moment of activation, think that you are now taking on the role of a student and, as a result, by the end of the Pomodoro, you should have -- read sections (pages), composed educational notes, and developed some Work Artifacts for the project. Try not to learn without enabling the Pomodoro tracker and without following the ritual! Write down how you understood this important student ritual, and if necessary, refer to the post in the SHSM club: https://systemsworld.club/t/zabyvaete-vklyuchat-treker-pomodoro-pochemu-eto-vazhno-i-kak-postavit-privychku/11580
4. Register in coda (for example, via the link: [https://dash.partnerstack.com/invite/47d92fe146214dec904c286c31f77015](https://dash.partnerstack.com/invite/47d92fe146214dec904c286c31f77015){target="_blank"}) or another similar program if you wish to model in a professional modeler.
5. Set up your workspace so that nothing distracts you during the course study. Ideally, choose a well-ventilated room, a comfortable chair, and a screen that allows splitting into two parts: on one, you study the course, and on the other, you take notes and model tables. Try to develop a ritual: sit at your workplace, activate the Pomodoro timer, prepare to take on the role of a student, and create various Work Artifacts.
6. Explain to yourself that while studying the course, you are not just taking notes, but are necessarily recording your thoughts, forming educational notes. If you are not yet sure how to take notes (you don't have your own knowledge base), we recommend recording your thoughts in the "Questions for review and further study" cells (this subsection is found in each section before the "Homework" subsection). For this, choose the most suitable question somewhat related to your thought, or record your thought in the cell with the last item "My notes on the studied section." In this way, while gradually studying the course section, you will gather answers to all questions, rather than writing them from scratch after reading the entire section.

Try to read the section during the first three days of the school week, and allocate the remaining time for modeling and completing homework. Meanwhile, the last day before training with the teacher (or the 6th day of the week) is reserved as a backup. If you plan everything correctly, you can use this day to revise learned material, assist fellow students, or comment on drafts in the SHSM club (not only classmates) or formulate questions for the teacher.
