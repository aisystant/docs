title: Types of Systems

**Systems in the environment** interact with the system of interest in various ways. For example, for a car, systems in the environment would include the driver and passenger, as well as the road, pedestrian, etc. There are systems in the immediate environment and those in the distant environment. Systems in the immediate environment, together with the system of interest, form a supersystem. In our example, the journey, besides the car, includes the driver and passenger. Systems in the distant environment are systems that interact with the system of interest during its operation. For example, the road and pedestrians.

**Subsystems**^[Subsystems exist for all three main systems, but if it is not specified which system is being referred to, we always assume it is the system of interest.] are parts of the system of interest. For a car, subsystems include the engine, cabin, chassis, etc. Subsystems are physically part of the system of interest, which in turn is a subsystem for the supersystem.

Thus, the chain subsystem-system of interest-supersystem represents **system levels**. Follow the arrows in the diagram: from "Subsystems," the arrow "enters" the "System of Interest," and the "System of Interest" "enters" the "Supersystem." For example, the engine is part of the car, and the car is part of the household.

The creating system, which consists of creating systems, does not belong to system levels. Its relationship with the system of interest is different â€” a relationship of creation or development. As you already know, the relationship between the system of interest and the supersystem is one of inclusion or a "part-whole" relationship.
