title: System of interest and collective systemic thinking
---

**The system of interest is common for the entire team** **or members of the extended enterprise!** It is necessary to manage collective activity and, primarily, collective attention. Thanks to the concept of a "system of interest," every team member understands that they are part of something larger and that their work result is part of the entire group's efforts (creating systems). However, each person in a role or enterprise department may have their own system, which they create or develop. It is called **"our system."**

The system of interest ties the attention of a large creator-team to one common goal. One can recall the story of how in 1962 at the NASA Space Center, President John Kennedy asked a janitor with a mop what he was doing. **"I, Mr. President, am** **helping** **put a man on the Moon."** Incidentally, for the janitor, "our system" would be the clean floor. He literally creates it with the mop, bucket, and cloth.

Similarly, in the large BMW corporation, there are many teams that create engines, conveyors, factory cafeterias, etc. But for all of them, the system of interest would be "the car." Whereas "our system" for each team would be the engine, conveyor, and cafeteria.

Choosing the system of interest occurs subjectively, and the entrepreneur^[The word "entrepreneur" has too many diverse meanings, so it is always better to specify.] is responsible for it, whom we will call a **visionary**. Of course, many team members can participate in information gathering, analysis, and decision-making, but the final word regarding the system of interest rests with the visionary. It is the visionary who "puts skin in the game." Many other decisions depend on his choice.

For example, Henry Ford, as an entrepreneurial visionary, decided that instead of horse-drawn carriages, a self-propelled carriage was needed^[Note that the word for this system might not yet have been found.]. Engineers then thought about how this system should be arranged. Systems are created collectively, with numerous roles involved. The final structure of the system of interest (its design, function, internal arrangement, etc.) depends on considering all stakeholders, not just the visionary. However, there is no way to ensure the system of interest is chosen correctly. This is entrepreneurial work: hypotheses must be proposed and tested, and entrepreneurial risk must be taken.

Systemic thinking simplifies this process, although it does not eliminate the need to propose an **entrepreneurial hypothesis**. Nevertheless, it helps avoid foolish mistakes. For instance, systemic thinking requires verifying that the system of interest is indeed physical and not documentation or something that doesn't change anything important in the physical world. It also draws attention to the supersystem, target audience problems, external project role needs, and other work artifacts in different areas of interest. Essentially, systemic thinking offers a checklist, and while it doesn't guarantee the success of the system of interest, it does protect against novice mistakes^[Such novice mistakes are more likely to occur when dealing with something new, complex, and unknown.].

It should be noted that most employees work on projects where the system of interest is already defined^[Although often a project is in full swing, few understand the system of interest. Nonetheless, it exists; team members just might not realize it.]. Someone in the visionary role has previously chosen the system of interest and launched a project to create, change, or improve it. Beginners studying systemic thinking need to practice identifying the system of interest in existing businesses and only then, if necessary, perform the role of a visionary^[You will have to play the role of a visionary, at least in personal projects.] and independently determine the system of interest in your work and personal projects.
