title: Our System
---

The concept of "our system" allows an individual or team to find their system or place in large collective activities. This could be the activity of your enterprise or multiple enterprises. In the latter case, one might speak of an **extended enterprise.** For example, various enterprises participate in sending a person to space.

Note that **our system can be a subsystem of the system of interest or one of the creating systems.** Thus, the activities of a large enterprise can be divided into numerous projects responsible for creating different "our systems." Each "our system" has a specific connection to the system of interest.

A Systems team and a systems specialist must understand how they participate in the vast activity of creating the system of interest. A significant practice of systems thinking is the ability to find your system among many others and understand its connection with other systems and teams creating these systems.

An extended enterprise involves a large number of teams, each dealing with their own system ("our system" is unique for each). For example, a team might create a car engine, meaning the engine is their "our system." Nevertheless, they will still consider the car their system of interest. This determines the team's connection with the larger group producing the car. The engine is "our system" for this team. In this case, "our system" is a part of the system of interest. However, for some team in an automotive company, "our system" might be the assembly line, and the assembly line in relation to the car is part of the creating systems.

Once again, we emphasize that **our system and the system of interest help people in the company see clearly** **their piece of work and understand how their work connects with the main result for the entire enterprise.**
