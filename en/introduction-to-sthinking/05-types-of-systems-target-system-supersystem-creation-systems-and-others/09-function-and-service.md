title: Function and Service
---

**The system of interest is conceived as a delivered product (physical object).** Such a system is usually manufactured by a project team from raw materials purchased by this team, and then physically delivered to the consumer. The product performs the requested function as part of a supersystem during operation.

For example, if you are a watch manufacturer, the watch is your system of interest. Clients use your systems in two ways:

-   First, as part of their system of interest. For instance, a client installs your watch product in their car product, sells the car to their customer, and the watch tells the time during the car's operation;
-   Second, the client uses the watch as part of the system creating their car product (the car is your client's product). For example, a client might install your watch on the wall of their assembly line so workers can keep track of time during car assembly.

**An alternative is to trade services rather than product systems.** You could conditionally send the exact time upon request. While the watch product might be preferable for a car or workshop over the service of providing exact time on demand, there is a well-known example of a service — a taxi. You can sell a car product, or you can sell a transportation service.

To provide a service, you need to create a system that will produce the service. You do not sell the system; the client pays you for the provided service. If we take the car example, the car is a product. You can sell it for the client to drive themselves as both driver and passenger, or you can offer a transportation service where the client is only a passenger. Your system organizing the transportation service consists of at least a car and a driver employed by you.

Typically, a creating system, or enterprise, offers the service. A good example is a hotel service. A hotel provides accommodation services.

**Service — is a behavior, work, or utility.** It is provided by a service enterprise or system: service equipment, server, service, provider. Do you feel the difference in words?

Let’s remember that we used to call system behavior a function. **By nature, function and service are the same. It's all system behavior** (functional or role-based). So why do we need two different terms?

The point is that these are different slangs characteristic of two different views. The term "function" is used by external project roles looking for specific behavior in a supersystem. We say that the system's function is assigned externally; it is needed in the supersystem. The term "service" is used by internal project roles who create the system to provide a service outwardly. But **will the provided service become the requested function**? Success will depend on that.

Thus, the term **"service" is the view from the system** **onto** **its environment. The reverse view, from the environment/supersystem** **onto** **the system** **— is function.** And indeed, a function may carry another name. A nail-driving service can become the function of fastening boards. A water-pumping service may become a function of antifreeze pressurization.

Function — is the system's behavior from the supersystem's side, when clients need a specific function for some reason. Service — is the system's behavior from its developer's side when they say, "I don't know why it's needed, but I can change the environment (world) with a certain service." Or use the term function to consider system behavior in the supersystem^[Or of a subsystem in the system.]
as a functional or role object. And use the term service to consider system behavior in the supersystem as a constructive object. Most often, service denotes the behavior of a creating system impacting the system of interest.

Therefore, don't be surprised when you hear two completely different conversations about the same item, product, and behavior: this is the peculiarity of different interests.

Often, clients may say they are dissatisfied with the provided service. This means clients expect a certain function, but the quality of service delivery doesn’t meet their expectations. For example, you spend a night at a hotel. You need to get a good night's sleep, wash, etc. This is one perspective. It happens in terms of needs and functions. But there's a perspective from the manager and other roles designing and managing the hotel. Here, the management team considers the services provided to guests. If the subsystems and the entire hotel are poorly designed^[For example, if the target audience's needs are not well understood by the hotel.], complaints about the quality of service arise. Clients cannot criticize their requests (i.e., they don't use the function slang), so they criticize using the language of the management company — stating that the service^[As we know, the term "service" is used by the creating team.]
is ineffective.

It's essential to understand that manufacturers and service-oriented **companies want to name their system products and services so that potential buyers quickly** **see their functional requests in them.** How well this is achieved is defined by the market.

Thus, it's important for companies to correctly position their services so that they aren't accidentally utilized by those not in the target audience. For instance, if AISYSTANT offers its current educational services to schoolchildren or casual learners, we will undoubtedly receive feedback about inadequate education.
