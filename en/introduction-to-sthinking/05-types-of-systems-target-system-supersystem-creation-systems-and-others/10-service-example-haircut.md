title: Service Example - "haircut"
---

Let's consider an example with a hair salon. A hair salon is in the services sector. It doesn't produce system-products in the way that a car factory does. If you ask anyone what a hair salon does, they will say that it cuts hair.

Thus, **the hair salon provides the service -- haircuts.** Moreover, it offers an "outwardly" standardized set of its actions: a Canadian cut, a model cut, etc. And when we talk about a hair salon, it's appropriate to speak in terms of "service," "services."

But a hair salon is a system-enterprise, and therefore it has a system of interest that the hair salon creates as a creating system. Such a **system of interest is the hairstyle**. The supersystem for a hairstyle would be a well-groomed head or a lady ready for a visit to the theater. In turn, systems in the environment can be highlighted -- makeup, earrings, dress.

The entire hair salon doesn't participate in the haircut service, so it's more accurate to name parts of the enterprise directly involved in this procedure. This includes the hairdresser with all their tools (technologies) like scissors^[In turn, scissors also provide a service -- cutting.], clippers, combs, etc. Thus, **there is an internal process with the hairdresser and scissors and an external service resulting from this internal process**. A Systems actor can discuss them separately, and thus there are different concepts -- process, service, systems.

In turn, the scissors system is created specifically for a particular functional purpose. Scissors' creators must understand the intended use or the function requested by the client^[Scissors' creators follow the principle: "the finger presses the table, but the table doesn't press the finger," meaning scissors are an active object that cuts hair, providing a service. Hair is considered a passive object. The action of the hair on the scissors is neglected in this consideration when examining the functional (role-based) behavior of scissors. But reverse consideration is also possible. It's all about focus. It's impossible to consider all interactions and interdependencies at once. For more details on why systemic thinking uses the principle of Aristotelian, not Newtonian physics, see the section "Aristotelian Physics in Systems Thinking" of the "Systems Thinking" textbook.]. It's one thing if it's a hairdresser, and another if it's a gardener. While the principle of scissors is identical, scissors are made for hairdressers and pruners (garden shears) for gardeners.

If this example is not clear enough to you, surely ponder it through thinking with writing. Also, write down questions you might ask in the course's support chat "Systems Thinking." For those who understand this example, try to provide a similar one.
