title: Supersystem, system levels, and recursion
---

In the diagram below, you see the same types of systems discussed earlier but from a slightly different perspective. This diagram from the "Systems Thinking" textbook illustrates that **differentiation of various systems occurs concerning a system of interest**. If we talk about a supersystem, there is a system of interest, and if there is a creating system, it always corresponds to a system of interest.

However, before identifying the system of interest, it is necessary to understand your roles, team, and enterprise. This understanding allows you to determine your responsibilities and authority, which influences the system level, boundaries of both the system of interest and our system. You may be authorized to create a piston, an entire engine, or a complete car. **Once you choose the system of interest, you can then build all other systems accordingly**, including defining "our system". However, sometimes it's the opposite: you have a good understanding of "our system" and only then start searching for the system of interest.

What should be done first with the supersystem? It is necessary to ensure that the system of interest is an integral, physical part of the supersystem at the time of operation, meaning it literally becomes part of the supersystem. For example, a pump is part of a pumping station. Unfortunately, most errors occur due to inattention to this characteristic of the supersystem.

**The same system of interest can have multiple supersystems**. It all depends on the context of using the system of interest. For example, the supersystem of a car might be "driver+car+passenger"^[It's difficult to find a name for such a system; perhaps "equipped crew"? Here, various project roles arise, systems in the environment (asphalt road or dirt road, pedestrians or wild animals, etc.).]. On the other hand, a car can be viewed in the context of a garage where it is parked. Then the garage with the car is also a separate supersystem for the car as the system of interest. There can be several such supersystems. From each such consideration, project roles, systems in the environment, needs, etc., are defined.

**System breakdown or system levels** is an embedding of systems within each other: a subsystem is part of the system of interest, which in turn is part of the supersystem. However, the creating system does not fit within this system breakdown, so it is highlighted separately in the diagram.

Another important principle can be deduced from the provided diagram: this is a kind of **recursion**. The supersystem of our project may be called a system of interest for our clients, and our system of interest may be a supersystem for someone else.

The naming of system types depends on the team working at a specific system level. It has authority and responsibility for systems at the corresponding level. For one team, the system of interest will be a car, and the battery will be a subsystem. However, your team might very well consider the battery as the system of interest. Particularly because it will be used in different supersystems: cars, homes, etc.

There is no clear template or strict rule on how to name systems. Each team independently decides what to call what they are working withâ€”"our system" or "system of interest". This is also a task for the visionary. Systems thinking only requires maintaining the principle of physical embedding while also separately considering systems in the environment and creating systems, along with other cognitive approaches.
