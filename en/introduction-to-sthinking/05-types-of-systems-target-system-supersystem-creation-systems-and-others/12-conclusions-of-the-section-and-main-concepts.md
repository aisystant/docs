title: Section Conclusions and Key Concepts

First, we became familiar with the following types of systems: system of interest, supersystem, creating systems, subsystems, systems in the environment, "our system." You need to practice applying these concepts to educational examples and then to work projects to gain fluency in dividing the world into different systems.

Second, we discussed the difference between activity and system, product and service, service and function. You may feel that many concepts are superfluous, but believe me â€” they are designed to more accurately describe the different interests discussed when creating a successful system.

One of the main Systems techniques is the ability to distinguish and see connections between the main types of systems.

**Key Concepts:** system of interest, supersystem, systems in the environment, creator-system, creating systems, our system, subsystem; behavior, activity, process, function, service.
