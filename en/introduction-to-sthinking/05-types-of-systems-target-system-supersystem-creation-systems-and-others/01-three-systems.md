title: Three Systems
---

In this section, you will learn about the types of systems you need to identify and work with in any project. Its purpose is to introduce you with simple examples to the system of interest, the supersystem, and the creating systems, as well as to teach you to distinguish between product and service, function and service.

In the modern systems approach, the following three main systems are highlighted, which help manage attention in complex project activities. These are the **system of interest, supersystem, and** **creator**.

Everything in the world is interconnected, so we highlight systems with attention, just as parts of an elephant are highlighted. By distinguishing the subsystem tail, we do not literally tear it from the body. Individual parts and the **system itself are highlighted from the general context** also **with attention**. For different projects and even within one project, the same physical object can be a different system or part of different systems.

At AISYSTANT courses, they teach techniques of this distinction and train fluency in working with each system and with all of them together. In this section, we will talk about each of the three main systems for now.

**System of Interest** is the main system for which project activity (or the process of creation and development) occurs. We consider separately the activity^[In this activity, the creating systems participate. You should already distinguish the type "activity" from the type "system".] and separately its result -- the system of interest. When we talk about an actor changing the world, we imply that he introduces some system of interest into the physical world. The system of interest is created to solve the problems of a specific group of people -- consumers, clients. For example, for the "BMW" concern, the system of interest might be the "i8" car.

**Supersystem** is the system in which the system of interest physically resides. The system of interest is part of the supersystem. This demonstrates the classic property of nested structure. The system of interest "car" may belong to the supersystems "household" or "fleet". The supersystem should be chosen based on the specific project. Itâ€™s impossible to simply name the supersystem based on the ideal system "car". The supersystem^[There might be several supersystems. This depends on the team that wants to consider different stakeholders. Each supersystem "brings" its own external project roles.]
must not only be defined but also thoroughly studied, hence we will further consider such a work artifact as a usage concept.

The main methodological approach consists of tracing **the physical nestedness of the system of interest in the supersystem**. This is where students usually stumble. System nestedness is easily seen when talking about "iron systems". For example, an engine is part of a car. However, as we already know, systems can be more complex^[For example, a water safety system.], and therefore it is necessary to train the ability to see the nested relationship and corresponding system levels^[System of interest and supersystem are two system levels. Creating systems do not fall into this system breakdown.].

The third kind of system is the **creator system** or the collection of **creating systems.** These are systems that participate in the conception, design, production, repair, and disposal of the system of interest. For example, the creator system is an organization, and creating systems are its subdivisions. We can also speak of an extended enterprise as a creator system, which includes many organizations.

For example, an extended enterprise creates the system of interest, a car, or different creating systems engage in car creation. They participate in the process of creating a car. That is, the "BMW" plant, dealers selling and repairing the car, and recyclers -- all are creating systems for the system of interest "BMW i8". Together, they form an extended enterprise or creator system.
