title: 'Example: Supersystem for a Man and a Woman'
---

Let’s consider a domestic example with agents in the form of a man and a woman. What supersystems can exist with them in certain roles? Yes, they interact in some way, they have functionality within the supersystem. What kind?

I hope you quickly realized that the supersystem here might be a family, and the woman and man are part of each other's systemic environment, performing the roles of husband and wife. That is, it is not a woman and a man who are part of the family, but a husband and wife.

The puzzle about the name of the supersystem can be solved by identifying a missing, unnamed, or undiscovered system in the system breakdown. This is a typical situation: **supersystems are usually poorly discernible; sometimes there are no established names for them**^[Often in culture, there are no established names for some systems, unlike the concept of "family". In your work projects, you will often have to introduce new system names. Remember that the name must be given based on the main function of the system.].

These “missing” systems have to be identified, that is, their roles or functions described, and somehow named based on the role. Sometimes you'll have to choose the most accurate words. For example, a supersystem needs to be found for a car with a driver and passenger, but there hasn’t been a good version yet. Once you find a suitable name for a system, a lot becomes clearer and simpler. Learn to correctly name systems and work with semantics^[Semantics is one of the 16 transdisciplines of the Intelligence Stack.].
