title: 'Perform Modeling: 2.4. Embodiment, Description, and Documentation of the System'
---

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material. Fill in the empty cells in the rows following the examples. Note that the presented data may apply to a large number of different situations, and you only need to provide at least one example. The main thing is to avoid methodological mistakes.

For your current or past projects (or projects known to you through friends), fill in the table with at least five embodiments of the system, descriptions of this system, and documents with descriptions of this system.

One example of a description and one document with that description is sufficient for each embodiment of the system, but more can be provided: one embodiment can have many descriptions, and one description can be documented on various media/in different documents. Only write the names of what's asked for in the table; you don't need to include full texts and diagrams!

If necessary, make notes for further development. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record your insights that arise when using writing-thinking as you fill out the table.

**Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
