title: Complex Systems

We can talk about complex systems, meaning the relationships of their components. At the beginning of the section, an example with a cocktail was given. But the embodiment of a system can be a **system** consisting of spatially separated 4D objects. For example, a water rescue system, which includes rescuers, boats, lifebuoys, etc. Such systems, unlike an airplane or engine, we will call complex systems.

**Complex systems are defined by the objects included in this complex system**. However, we do not call complex systems processes; these are different types of concepts. They cannot be confused just as one cannot confuse types like "furniture chair" and "color red," "cities" and "countries," "roles" and "titles," etc.

When we say **"process,"** it means that we stop considering the system, switch our attention^[Just like switching attention from description to embodiment or documentation of the system.] and now focus on the interaction of several systems with each other. We can also consider the process occurring within the system.

A process is usually called a verb or a verbal noun. For example, the process of "nailing." It is very difficult to detect the process of nailing. The processes themselves, as changes, are invisible (remember, the process of movement is noticeable by the system). But you can imagine a process as an enumeration of physical objects involved in it. That is, "nailing" consists of a nail, hammer, board, and carpenter.

It is a bit more difficult to detect objects in the process if a stone plays the role of a hammer, a wall plays the role of a board, and you yourself play the role of a carpenter, and therefore forget to include yourself in the process.

However, this reduction of "processes" to material objects that change each other in interaction remains a reliable method for finding jobs, actions, practices, processes, functions, services, and other behavior in the physical world. However, it is crucial not to forget that **a process is not a system,** **but** **the interaction of systems**. This interaction is what is important to us. For example, the word "performance" indicates that an action (process) is happening in which actors, music, and stage participate. Meanwhile, the complex system is the theater, which includes numerous systems.

To understand complex systems and processes, **look for actions in the world not indicated by verbs,** **but** **objects indicated by nouns** that behave in interaction, manifesting their behavior in the world. Although it is not always possible to find precisely meaningful names, they may not exist in culture or may be associated with other types. For example, think about what the word "dance" means: is it a system or a process?

You can think more or less the same way about the most complex and simplest systems, indicating the universality of systems thinking. By understanding it, you will save a lot of mental energy and be able to quickly comprehend the most complex situations and projects.
