List the five or more concepts from this section that were most memorable to you, and next to them, indicate the concepts with which they are most associated for you. Other concepts may be from your current worldview, so it is not necessary to provide only the main concepts of this section. Discuss these concepts with peers, colleagues, or close ones. For example, try to explain these concepts in simple terms, give examples from your experience, connect different concepts with each other, or explain their importance.
