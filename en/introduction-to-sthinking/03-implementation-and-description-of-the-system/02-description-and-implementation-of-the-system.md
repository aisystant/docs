title: System definition and implementation
---

The Systems Management School course "Rational Work" **teaches
to distinguish between the physical world and the mental space in speech
or writing**. This course also trains linking abstract reasoning to the
physical world. People cannot do without mental concepts; they help communicate.
But one must not lose sight of physical world objects behind words and symbols.
"Taking off the ground" is especially not recommended in project activities,
otherwise it will be difficult to create successful systems.

For example, a bankruptcy manager might mistakenly believe that his activity's goal is to register the liquidation of the enterprise in the database. However, this registration is just information that certifies that all remaining assets of the enterprise have been distributed to creditors. These assets exist in the physical world, they are the manager's goal and his system. And the registry entry merely describes this system. Therefore, in any activity **one should not confuse the system with its description**. This thinking strategy (and skill) needs training. But first, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the concepts of "system implementation" and "system description".

In systems thinking, the concepts of "**system implementation**" and
"**system description**" **pertain to different realms**. "Implementation" means
physically realized material objects, while "description" emphasizes
that the discussions pertain to the mental space, i.e., not the system's very essence.

In this context, the notion "system implementation" seems tautological,
since by saying "system," we already imply a physical object existing in reality.
However, the word "implementation" is deliberately used with the word "system"
to contrast it with the phrase "system description." Often, when they talk about
"system implementation," they discuss "system description" in parallel^[Therefore, you can use the concept of a "system" without the word "implementation."
But if you want to emphasize that the system and its description are
separately considered, use the concepts "system implementation" and
"system description".].

A system's implementation can be an individual **system** **as a physical object**.
For instance, a "Blue Lagoon" cocktail in hand or this specific pencil.
These objects are literally represented in the physical world, existing in four dimensions (4D): length-width-height and time^[Note that this is not an abstract chair or car, which have no attachment to physical space and time.].

When describing a system, we use word-terms that define its **characteristics, properties, actions, features, behavior, states**, etc. For example, terms like color, price, height, weight, desires, and so on. These words differ from those like "car," "table," or "clock," which denote physical objects.

To describe a system, it is necessary to possess certain **description methods**^[More about this concept in section 6.]. Every characteristic will have its worldviews, theories, and disciplines. If you need to describe a car's price, you must know pricing practices (description methods), and if a business is described for a shareholder, you cannot do without understanding financial reporting according to IFRS or US GAAP and the specific technology for preparing the corresponding financial documents (e.g., SAP).

System descriptions are initially abstract. This concept is necessary to focus attention on the substantive aspect of the discussed system. But descriptions can be tied to the physical world, that is, to focus on the form. To achieve this, look at the information medium containing the system's description. And then it refers to **system documentation**^[When discussing system description, it marks the importance of content or essence characterizing some system. But when speaking about documentation, the emphasis shifts to the fact that this content can be read, viewed, calculated, etc., on a specific medium. The more concepts, the more confusion. But if you study these concepts, order and clarity will emerge.].

Using the concept of **system documentation** means that the focus shifts mainly to the physical medium containing the system's description^[When you hear or read the word "description," determine by the context what is meant: actually the "description," or a "document with a description." Often when they say "description," both could be meant.]. For example, a menu is a system's documentation of a "cocktail". It contains a description of the cocktail: its composition, price, photo, etc.

**Documentation is often created using** **tools (technologies)** that implement a specific discipline used for describing the system. For example, the documentation "Financial Reporting by US GAAP" is formed using the SAP IT system.

Thus, the ability to distinguish between the notions of system implementation, description,
and documentation and find these concepts in your life is an important cognitive strategy. Without the skill to swiftly separate these concepts, further study of systems thinking will be impossible.
