title: System and its role behavior
---

We have already considered the function of a system as the desired action or **role behavior** **of the system.** This desired action is assigned by people, meaning things (systems) do not choose their functions. People need not so much the thing itself (material object), but its function. Stakeholders value a system for its function, although often the layman does not distinguish them.

**Systems skill -- is a separate consideration and discussion of the function** that someone needs, and **construction**, which best suits the performance of this function. More about this distinction will be discussed in the following sections of the course.

**Role behavior of a system --- is the way in which the system performs its functions and interacts with the environment**, following a certain role. In systems thinking, the system is viewed as a "role object", which actively changes its environment while performing its function.

Simply put, a system plays its role in a "play" or "game" where its actions and methods of operation are defined by its role. For example, if you are a customer in a pizzeria, you follow certain actions like ordering pizza and paying for it. If you start asking for sandals in a pizzeria, the staff will step out of their usual role and begin to understand what is happening because you broke the role structure.

The main idea is that **roles and methods of work must be aligned:** first, we determine what needs to be changed in the environment of the system of interest, then choose the way to do it, and only then determine the role of the system, methods of work, and the role of the creators of the system^[To learn more about how this works, refer to the section "Mantra of systems thinking" and "Game metaphor" in the "Systems Thinking" course.]. This sequence helps to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings in projects.
