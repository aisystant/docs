Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, revisit the theoretical material and use the AI bot Aisystant if needed. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the examples. If you lack the breadth of experience to select the necessary words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google or consult familiar experts.

Provide examples from work and personal projects by listing the subsystems of your company's systems. If needed, make notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a reflection or a question that can later be asked in support chats or record a thought for a future draft. You can also leave feedback for the course developers in the "Notes."
