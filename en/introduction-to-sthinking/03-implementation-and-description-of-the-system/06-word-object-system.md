title: Word, Object, System
---

Let's learn another thinking technique and learn to distinguish "word," "object^[Here we are talking about a physical object, not all objects, among which there can be abstract ones.]," and "system."

Let's take the word "hammer" as an example. **In language, it is quite difficult to separate the word "hammer" from the physical object "hammer,"** that is, this specific hammer in my hand. In Russian, it is all tightly fused for us. But if, for example, a Chinese person said the word "hammer" in Chinese, we would only hear a set of sounds and would not even think about the object "hammer." So the word is just sounds and signs (letters) put together. It's people who name this word a particular physical or abstract object.

A word can denote a physical object that is called by this word in culture. Usually, before this "word," some system appears, and the inventor gives it a name, or this name is later formed by the culture (as a class of certain physical objects). For instance, at one time there was the expression "automatic self-moving carriage" or "horse-less carriage," but then the word "automobile" was attached to this system. In general, this is a **cultural tendency -- to find a short name for the system,** although initially the inventor used a long phrase.

A good **name for a system** **means that** **its main function is clear from the name.** Another example: an airplane or a system that flies independently. Often, the names of systems, roles, and items come from other languages. For example, the word "chauffeur" came from French and was connected to the function of "heater." Read more about this in the post "Chauffeur and Driver" in the AISYSTANT club^[[https://systemsworld.club/t/shofer-i-voditel/8561](https://systemsworld.club/t/shofer-i-voditel/8561){target="_blank"}].

Later, the name of the system is attached to a specific object, or we call certain objects by this invented word. But we must clearly understand that the **system** **"hammer"** **is not equal to** **the typical** **physical** **object** **"hammer"** (this one in my hand), which is well imagined in the culture. The word is the same, but the meaning is different, and in systems thinking, it's necessary to keep this in mind.

In the first case, we pay attention to the fact that we **need a system that performs the function of driving nails.** By the way, probably this system would be called -- nail driver or just an item for driving nails. Later, the short name of the system -- "hammer" -- was entrenched in the culture. But this role can be performed by physical objects like "stone" or "microscope." And certainly, the best performer for this role is the typical physical object "hammer"^[This item was actually invented for this purpose and then named with this word. And now common people do not need to understand what is being discussed in a specific case. But a system practitioner must master the technique of distinguishing words in context. By the way, good and bad performers will always vie for specific work roles, for instance, manager.].

Specific types of objects that usually perform a certain function are, of course, conveniently named with one word. And culture usually handles this well. That's why it's **so difficult for us to separate** **the word, physical object, and system** "hammer." But a system practitioner must easily understand this from the context in any projects. The fact is that we understand everything about the hammer, but when it comes to complex work projects, it might not be so simple. Therefore, we begin to understand from the example of the "hammer," and then apply the same thinking techniques in work projects.

When you figure out this separation, it will become easier for you to understand what physical and functional objects are, what a system is, and other concepts of systems thinking.
