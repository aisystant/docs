title: Conclusions of the section and main concepts
---

In this section, we discussed the mental technique of distinguishing between embodiment, description, documentation, and function of a system. It can be said that any description is a description of a system. The system description becomes accessible to people when it is documented.

The main relationships in systems are "part-whole" relationships, also known as composition/assembly relationships. Divisions are made exclusively by attention, nothing in the physical world is specifically broken into parts!

Any system has a function or role behavior that is necessary for some external design roles. Systems are usually named after their primary purpose or their main function.

Complex systems are defined through objects that are included in the given complex system. In this case, we do not call complex systems processes, these are different types of concepts.

**Main concepts**: physical world, mental space; system definition, system embodiment, system documentation; description method; functional object=role object, role behavior=function=purpose in the environment (system purpose); physical object=role performer=module; naming systems; "part-whole" relationship=composition/assembly relationship, system division, system levels; complex system, process.
