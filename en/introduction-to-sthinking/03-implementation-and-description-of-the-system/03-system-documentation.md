title: Systems Documentation

Let's talk more about documentation. You already know that **systems documentation is the system definition in some physical medium.** This can be a spare parts catalog, a product brochure, a computer system model, or text on paper. Note that the words^[Now always pay attention to the words of the interlocutor. For example, how often does he use words from the physical world or mental space? Or what does he want to discuss now: a meaningful question, the form of content, or something else?] can understand the following: physical world objects are listed here â€“ a brochure, a computer model, paper. But, speaking of media, we said nothing about the content of the description. It can be seen, read, heard, etc. It characterizes the system by various parameters^[By which parameters? By those that interest numerous stakeholders.].

The concepts "embodiment," "description," and "documentation" are needed to avoid confusion in discussing the system. These concepts manage attention, helping to discuss each aspect separately rather than mixing everything^[Our brain does not have enough computational power to discuss the system in several perspectives at once. Moreover, these concepts may interest different roles.]. Let's consider an example. **A system can be a human as a biological entity.** They are an object of the physical world and exist "in the flesh," meaning the "human" system is literally embodied in reality. It has numerous descriptions such as height, weight, hair, and skin color, etc. There is also a description in the form of a surname, first name, and patronymic.

When we talk about descriptions, we understand that they are not in the physical world. By naming a person, we mention the person's description. It is in the mental space. But there is also documentation of the system: birth certificate, passport, international passport, driver's license, and so on. These documents contain a specific description of the "human" system. **Documents are presented in the physical world and contain a description**^[A content characteristic of the system.]**, which interests some project roles.** For example, a driver's license interests the traffic inspector. Without these interests, there would be no description, and there would be no need for this documentation.

The same division into embodiment, description, and system documentation can be made concerning inanimate objects. Take, for example, a milkshake. On one side, this beverage in the physical world is the embodiment of the system. At the same time, this milkshake has various descriptions: name, recipe, etc. And there is system documentation on a paper medium, indicating the name and composition, and there is documentation in the form of a menu with a photo and price of the drink.

**Descriptions refer to** **specific** **characteristics or properties of the system.** This information does not exist in the real world. For example, you cannot say that a person's age "42 years" is somewhere in the physical world and has its length-width-height-time (4D dimension). You can point to the person, but that would be the embodiment of the system. You can only point to the number "42" in the physical world if it is on a specific information carrier.

Thus, **documentation can be presented** in the form of an IT model, diagram, table, text on paper, or in the computer. That is, when we say "documentation," we mean focusing on the information carrier. It is the priority in the discussion until the words "embodiment" or "description" appear in the conversation.

**Descriptions can be informal and formal.** Most people do not realize the importance of formal descriptions and only suffice with informal ones. In complex projects, when we work with numerous interests, formal descriptions are necessary: created by some method and placed on a medium. They help to understand the subject of interest, as by starting to make descriptions, you better understand the stakeholders. Informal descriptions often remain in people's minds and may not have a formal description method behind them. Much of what is just skimmed over in the mind gets forgotten.

As we said earlier, formal descriptions of items of interest are created using specific **description methods** **(practices)**. In the description method, there is a conceptual minimum and principles. This is covered in the "Rational Work" course. Systems thinking relies on the knowledge of ontology (ontology and logic); therefore, in system description, it is necessary to be able to read and create different system models and work with models understandable to the computer.

To create a successful system, it is necessary to satisfy certain role interests. This satisfaction occurs through the creation of models that respond to the selected items of interest to the system. That's why it's so important to understand system descriptions. **To embody a successful system in reality,** **you need to work with system descriptions.** And they depend on the items of interest to project roles.

**Most of you work with numerous systems descriptions.** Try to list in tables on modeling the documents you create or those you participate in making, or documents made by your colleagues that you use in the work process. Match each document with the system it describes. Besides, think about which systems are described in your enterprise's development strategy or another similar document.

Although modern office workers deal with descriptions, it is essential not to lose sight of the physical world. Always look for the system's embodiments. Systems thinking, first of all, is about the physical world, although it deals with descriptions: "**descriptions are nothing, but what they describe is everything**!" All descriptions are made only to change what is described in the physical world!
