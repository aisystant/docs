title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.13. My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects'
---

Fill in the blank lines with your main roles from work and personal projects. Provide at least 10 roles. Try to cover all your work projects and all life areas (family, health, finances, friends, leisure, etc.). The more roles you perform well, the more likely you have an interesting life. Calculate the average level of applied skills at the end. Create notes for further elaboration as needed. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can record a question to ask in the support chat or note a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding task for modeling in your workspace by number and complete all its points.**
