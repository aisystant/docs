title: What's next?
---

You have studied all sections of the course. I hope you also completed all the homework, including drafting and modeling.

During the course, you started mastering systems techniques and concepts. And you have already tried applying something in your projects. For now, this is a patchwork application of systems thinking, and you are probably just beginning to understand how to view collective activity. But to do something, you will have to take the courses "Systems Thinking" and "Methodology," and actively use systems thinking in your work activities.

As the next step, I recommend continuing education in the main "Organizational Development" program and definitely implementing a work project, gradually improving your understanding of systems thinking. I hope to see you soon among the masters of the School of Systems Management. On the AISYSTANT website on the "Qualifications" page^[[https://system-school.ru/qualification](https://system-school.ru/qualification){target="_blank"}], you can familiarize yourself with the steps of life mastery.

Having understood the basics of systems thinking, you can start working with your environment. Regardless of your title, I recommend engaging colleagues and employees for detailed elaboration of specific work documents using systems thinking concepts.

To do this, it is necessary and even imperative to start educating colleagues. Firstly, collective systems thinking is much more productive than individual thinking. Secondly, the best practice for studying something complex is to explain it to others. By explaining systems thinking to someone, you understand it better yourself. Thirdly, it's interesting to become leaders of change, initiating and conducting team, corporate, and global transformations.

Why not become the person who can lead systems changes in the enterprise? Aim for the title of Development Director or someone responsible for organizational changes, including the currently trendy digital transformation. The ability to initiate changes, lead them, and successfully implement them is what AISYSTANT tries to teach. It’s our recipe for a happy, successful, and interesting life.

I will be happy to answer your questions beyond the course. Always feel free to reach out to me on Telegram: [https://t.me/TserenTserenov](https://t.me/TserenTserenov){target="_blank"}. And I won’t say goodbye. You have embarked on the path of systems thinking, and I hope you will strive not to deviate from it, continuously and endlessly developing and creating successful systems.
