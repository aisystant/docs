title: Work and Task
---

**Work** is a specific activity or behavior of an org unit, carried out at a specific physical time. As a result of work, a work artifact appears in the physical world. It can also be stated that it is a process in which the org unit participates along with resources. Or within this process, the org unit performs a service using certain resources.

For example, Ivan uses a hammer to drive nails within a specified time and receives payment for it. Ivan in the position of a carpenter with a hammer is the org unit. And the service is driving nails.

When discussing work, the main interest is not so much in its content^[That is, what methods (tools) are needed to perform the work.], but in how to gather the necessary resources for this work, as well as which org unit should perform this work to produce the necessary work artifact.

Managers often play the role of **planners**, who, based on the planning method, allocate work to executors. They are interested in who from the executors, within what timeframe and with what resources should create a certain work artifact.

Each cell of the 3x3 Table can be viewed as a set of **tasks** that need to be performed^[For each cell of the 3x3 Table there is its planner.]. It can also be said that the description in the subsection “How System thinking helps in work activities” about the essence of system thinking can be considered as high-level or typical tasks that need to be done in any project. For example, it is necessary to develop a usage concept or obtain investments.

**Tasks emerge as a result of system modeling**, and to be executed, they must be formulated as work. A task includes an action that must be completed within a project. Preferably, it should mention the method. A task becomes work when it is known:

1. Who or which executor (Full Name);
2. By what deadline;
3. In what role;
4. By what method (practice);
5. With what resources;
6. What work artifact will result.

To correctly formulate work, the planner must have accessible information about the availability of resources (time, funds, and components) and the skills of the executors.

The **enterprise architect** must allocate org units (departments) in such a way that each can work with maximally autonomous teams. Otherwise, it will be impossible to coordinate all the work which contains tasks for each cell of the 3x3 Table, also considering the incremental development of the system of interest. Note that the project may involve the development of numerous "our systems" for various teams. This further complicates work management. You will learn more about this in the third semester of the main program.
