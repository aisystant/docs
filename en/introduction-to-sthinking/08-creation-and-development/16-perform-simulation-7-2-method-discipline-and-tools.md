title: 'Perform modeling: 7.2. Method: discipline and tools'
---

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Note that several methods are used in your activities, and each method can be implemented by different tools.

Provide examples from work and personal projects. Consider three or more tasks you performed at work, spending more than two hours a day on them. In what role did you do this, what methods did you use, where are these methods described? Also, specify the best alternative method (considered but discarded when choosing the way to perform the work â€” the best of the discarded options).

**Find the corresponding task number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
