title: Systems thinking as a method of obtaining work for creating a successful system
---

This subsection concludes the detailed analysis of the concepts of systems thinking, and therefore we will gather together everything covered in previous sections. It is particularly important to understand how the team uses the 3x3 Table in project activities.

As you already know, this table draws the team's attention to the most important aspects to consider in project activities.

The table is built on the connection between **areas** **of interest** **of three main systems and three main roles.** Each cell of the 3x3 Table accumulates various subjects of interest to different systems, lists roles and methods, and provides examples of work artifacts (documentation) that should be developed in the process of working on the system of interest.

In the process of working on the system of interest, several systemic levels and chains of creation need to be considered. You can work with "our system," which may be a subsystem of the system of interest or the creating system. Or within your activity, it is necessary not only to create or develop the system of interest but also to implement organizational changes in the organization.

There are many teams that create and develop successful systems (systems of interest and creating systems) without fully utilizing a system approach. The matter is that the creation and development of systems ultimately involve performing specific tasks by agents-executors with resources. These tasks do not necessarily have to be defined in a systemic way. For example, they can be done from experience, by trial and error, etc. Moreover, **if you have ample resources, you will succeed in creating a successful system one way or another:** you can always hire the best agents, purchase the best tools, and verify your hypotheses as many times as needed. Therefore, large companies and market leaders have greater chances of survival than smaller ones.

Systems thinking is one way of obtaining work, but it is not the only one. However, applying systems thinking offers a chance to outperform leaders or increases the likelihood of creating successful systems in shorter time frames and with smaller budgets. Although the probability is, of course, not 100%. Nevertheless, systems thinking techniques allow obtaining necessary work based on system modeling, which is described in the 3x3 Table. It is a kind of checklist that ensures nothing is overlooked in the process of creating and developing the system of interest.

We do not speak of a 100% probability of success because, firstly, this checklist contains only hypotheses. For example, hypotheses regarding customer dissatisfaction or system architecture hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis-testing cycle still has to be run, and this concerns all cells of the 3x3 Table. Secondly, the creation of relevant work artifacts will require applied methods and professional executors. Nonetheless, **systems thinking provides fundamental clarity** regarding where to start when facing something new and complex.

In the end, systems thinking shows why certain works are necessary, what is expected as outcomes, and sets a trend for subsequent actions. All this **reduces chaos in the mind and gives confidence in one's actions**.
