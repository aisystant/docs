title: Work Management

Work management differs from practice management. Practice management is attention to the methods (practices) that will create all work artifacts according to the 3x3 Table. It is necessary to understand which practices are needed, implement them in the organization, and monitor their relevance. In turn, work management is based on established practice management.

**Work Management** (operation management or operations management) is the allocation of resources to implement plans on time and within budget. Here, **work stages** appear, which, as you know, differ from logical stages where practices follow one another^[For example, first, the wall is cleaned and plastered, and then it is painted, not the other way around.]. However, detailed planning for all stages is rarely used now because life quickly makes adjustments. Only the upcoming stage is planned in detail, and all subsequent ones are considered with significant assumptions, as the situation will likely change significantly when work on these stages begins.

Practice management is an engineering discipline, meaning one needs to know engineering work practices well. Meanwhile, work management is a purely managerial discipline, meaning one needs to know **operations management** well.

Work management abstracts from the engineering essence of operations, namely system modeling, whose results are generally presented in the 3x3 Table. All work within project activities or at the enterprise level is somehow connected to areas of interest.

Knowledge about how to perform work is not particularly needed by the operations manager. **The manager's goal** is to **achieve** **the fastest and cheapest execution** **of work to obtain the work artifact based on system modeling**. Managerial methods are used for this. For example, if the productivity of a conveyor line is insufficient, the manager decides to add several more machines. He is not concerned with what processing the machine performs, whether it can be done by another method and tools. He resolves the bottleneck with a managerial approach. Finding another practice to solve the same productivity problem is already practice management or an organizational development project, which the development director handles^[Any problem can be solved with engineering, managerial, or entrepreneurial practices. For example, you can change the way of working, add resources and executors, or focus on another problem instead of solving it.].

**Work management is a combination of different practices such as project management, process management, and case management**. Each practice is characterized by its set of interests and the corresponding method of describing the work flow. But they all have the main goal - to accelerate the work flow while minimizing their cost.

**Project Management** is upfront planning, which includes checkpoints, resources, start and end times, output norms, etc. For example, project management is well used in building construction when the design bureau has prepared the project documentation. Builders simply need to perform the necessary work according to specific stages.

**Process Management** involves similar work, a typical sequence of steps, usually defined by regulations rather than the plan. Process management can be used at the building's operational stage. Here you see such processes as cleaning, garbage removal, routine maintenance, etc.

**Case Management** is a more modern way of managing work. A case is a situation, circumstances, or initiative that requires a set of actions to achieve a goal. It focuses on the subject upon which actions are performed. For example, a person, a legal case, an insurance case. The case depends on the emerging circumstances, as it is impossible to calculate all the work in advance. Case management is conveniently applied at the life cycle stages of inception and design because it's difficult to plan, yet work needs to be managed. Here, the case concept is very helpful.
