Taking on a managerial role is always a challenge, especially if you're new to managing people. You might be an excellent specialist—a marketer, engineer, or doctor. But a managerial title involves not just knowledge of the subject matter but also knowledge of management. Ideally, it should be Systems Management^[Therefore, it is recommended to take our main program "Organizational Development".].

The methodology of systems management is universal, no matter what you lead: a small department of 3 people, a large production facility, or a multinational company. It is much easier to grasp the ideas of systems management within a small unit and then apply them as you grow.

For young managers just starting their journey in team management, it's important to understand two key areas of work:

- operational activities;
- organizational development.

Of course, it is also important to understand what product (system of interest) the company produces, but you already have a good understanding of that.

Operational activities are your foundation as the person responsible for current work. The operations of your unit should run like clockwork. It's important that production is timely, meets specific quality standards, and stays within budget. For example, imagine a production line where every employee knows their role and performs it impeccably, ensuring uninterrupted operations.

Organizational development comes into play when it comes to developing and upgrading your "conveyor belt." This could include implementing new work methods, utilizing new tools, or changing the team's structure to improve efficiency. For example, consider an IT company deciding to adopt a new work method, such as Agile methodology, which speeds up product development. The leader must not only motivate the team to adopt new methods but also set an example of adaptability and readiness for change.

As a leader, you need to motivate employees to work in both directions and demonstrate high performance and openness to innovations yourself. Your task is to create a team that is ready and able to work in both areas—operational activities and organizational development. Typically, employees understand operational activities well but are not inclined towards organizational changes of the conveyor they work on.

It's also important to work not only with your team but also with your environment. Your efforts to change may impact not only your unit but the entire organization. Therefore, it is crucial to have the support of your superiors and related departments. For example, if you manage the marketing department and see a need to improve processes for working with clients, it may require collaboration with the product development, sales, and IT departments to implement a new CRM system.

Remember, if you don't engage with your superior, they will engage with you and communicate their agenda and ideas, not all of which will be systemic if your superior hasn't studied systems methodology like you have. This means you should actively participate in shaping your agenda, offering ideas and showing initiative. Your goal is to make your superior an ally and like-minded partner in implementing necessary changes.

In conclusion, remember that success in a leadership role depends on your ability to manage current operations, as well as your vision and ability to implement systemic changes. Be a leader who isn't afraid of challenges and is ready for constant development, both personal and team development.
