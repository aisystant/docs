title: Stages and Phases
---

The concepts of “stage” and “phase” relate to time, but stages are tied to methods (practices) and logical time, whereas phases are related to tasks and physical time.

**Methods (practices)** **can be arranged** **sequentially** **in**
**logical time and, if necessary,** **distinct stages can be identified**. For example, to create the system “painted wall,” we can identify the following methods: putty application, sanding, painting, drying.

From this, by the way, functional parts of the organization that will paint the wall can be determined. In this functional view, we do not yet address when this will be done and by which agents (performers). We will address this when we engage in tasks.

It's not always possible to immediately identify all necessary methods, and it's not always convenient to work with a multitude of practices, so they can be grouped into specific stages. For example, initially, a “cleaning” stage with putty application and sanding practices, and a “painting” stage with painting, drying, and repainting practices could be identified.

In creating many systems, such universal stages as conceptualizing, modeling, creation, and operation are often identified. However, within each stage, unique practices or sub-practices for creating a specific system of interest are determined. Accordingly, substages can also be distinguished.

Practices in stages^[And the stages themselves are arranged in
logical order, as seen from the list of universal
stages.] and substages are arranged in a specific
logical order, meaning creation usually follows modeling.
But different practices and stages can be implemented simultaneously, unlike phases, which follow strictly one after another in physical time.

**The list of practices and their logical order are determined by the concept and architecture of the system**. A task must be "assigned" to each practice. Just as a function of the system is assigned a construction-module. Each task is performed by an organizational unit playing some role in some practice at a certain time and using some resource. As a result, the organizational unit receives a work artifact.

Each **phase contains a certain list of tasks, and phases follow**
**strictly** **one after another in physical time**. Tasks within a phase are carried out by different organizational units sequentially or in parallel. Phases are determined by managers who need to obtain certain work artifacts, without which moving to other phases is impossible.

For instance, a manager can define a phase as the sale of the system. For them, the milestone is a signed contract. But at this phase, besides marketing practices, the stages of conceptualizing and designing the system, or even creating the system, could certainly be carried out. At least the first version of the system or MVP. Or, conversely, it may be decided not to carry out any work on creating the system until a contract is signed. Therefore, managers determine which tasks are included in a specific phase.

**The highlighting of phases depends on** **the management methods of tasks**, which will be discussed in the next subsection. Phases of work can be pre-planned or opened as needed. Tasks can be assigned to all phases in advance. These would then be methods of project or process task management. Or they can be determined as circumstances arise, and then it would be case management or case handling.

At the same time, tasks can be organized in such a way that **methods logically following each other** **are** **carried out simultaneously.** For example, one team cleans the second wall while another team paints the already cleaned first wall. Such a division of methods and tasks, stages and phases allows for conveniently discussing the activities of creating systems.
