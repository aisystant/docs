Creating and developing systems is considered in relation to different systems. In any project activity, multiple systems are created and developed at different systemic levels and chains of creation. At a minimum, the creation and development of the system of interest and systems of creation occur.

Systems thinking establishes important objects of attention for any activity. We start with the domain of interest of the supersystem, meaning we look at the world we want to change in some way. Then we move to the system of interest and its structure. Further, we discuss the creating system, including methods of creation, roles, and resources.

Techniques and concepts of systems thinking are applied to the enterprise system through concepts such as org-role, org-unit, method, work, service, and others.

Systems thinking can be considered one of the ways of obtaining work artifacts. Techniques of systems thinking allow us to obtain the necessary work artifacts based on systems modeling, which is described in the 3x3 Table. It is a kind of checklist of what must not be forgotten in the process of working on the creation and development of the system of interest.

Key concepts: practice, method, org-role, work artifact, discipline, tool, work management, method management, method manager, enterprise architect, stages, phases, organization, org-unit, service, principle of continuity, iteration, increment, functional description of the enterprise system, modular description of the enterprise system.
