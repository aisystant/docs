Next, let's examine the connection between stages, methods, and roles. The picture shows the stages -- design, manufacturing, and operation. At each stage, different roles can use different methods.

This approach allows us to see how, from a functional point of view, a company that creates the system of interest operates. At each stage, different functional parts of the enterprise or organizational roles apply different methods.

Choosing the main organization methods is an important architectural decision about how the enterprise will be structured. This decision is made by the enterprise architect. Identifying the necessary methods and positioning them at stages is **management of practices** **(methods)**.

The systems team always understands which method they use to create the system of interest and does not overlook important methods that determine the competitiveness of the enterprise. However, there must be an executor in the role of **practice manager**^[And the title can be CTO (chief technology officer).]**.**
