title: Management of Practices
---

**Work Management** is a fully managerial practice, whereas **management of practices** is half engineering and half managerial. The practice manager should not be confused with the developer or architect of the system itself, though they also engage in engineering work. Their focus is on the methods and practices of engineers working on the system of interest, including which practices are employed by developers and architects.

Management of practices involves **the selection of necessary methods** and **structuring work according to them** within an organization.

The methods manager ensures the coherence of method configuration, checks, and supports the use of methods and tools. It is noteworthy that the methods manager often holds the position of CTO (chief technology officer) and/or CIO (chief information officer). They possess a deep understanding of practices leading to successful system creation. The methods manager must have good knowledge of the technological operations and services that will provide creating systems, to create the system of interest. They also establish the logical sequence for implementing practices, including identifying stages.

Management of practices answers the question **“how does the organization operate to result in a successful system.”** This practice is engineering to the extent that it deals with practices as functional and role behaviors of the creating system. However, this practice defines the arrangement of the creator system and is therefore considered in cell 3.2 of the 3x3 Table.

Unlike a tree or bird^[Biological, natural systems develop autonomously, their development is ingrained through evolution. But engineering systems require the involvement of engineers.], a car and a house do not build themselves, and a rocket does not launch itself into space. Someone must determine the methods and approaches to use, and in what order. That's what methods managers do. The methods manager’s focus is on creating systems, **their work artifact is trained individuals knowledgeable in practices and equipped with the necessary technologies/tools.**

**The practice manager should not be confused with the enterprise architect**. The latter is concerned with questions about the modular structure of the enterprise, namely, how to divide it into organizational units to then assign those units to relevant practices. What those practices will be, their completeness, and the logical sequence of implementation is the concern of the practice manager. They conduct substantive discussions on engineering work methods.
