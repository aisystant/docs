title: 'Perform Simulation: 7.12. Examples of Brief Project Descriptions (Project Summary)'
---

Review the examples in the first rows of the table. Note that such a description in text has already been encountered in textbooks. The table provides a brief description that is created at the beginning of the project and then used for detailing in other descriptions, as well as for aligning the understanding of all team members. Create at least three summaries of your work or personal projects.

As needed, make notes for further elaboration. You may not create a good description right away and might need to return to it several times.
