title: 'Perform Modeling: 7.14. Degree of Thinking Mastery'
---

Rate on a ten-point scale how much you have learned thinking mastery in university, how much you added through self-education, and how much you gained in AISYSTANT. The total can be no more than 10 points for each transdiscipline (university + self-study + AISYSTANT).

It doesn't matter if you don't fully understand the content of all the transdisciplines of the Intelligence Stack: try to guess based on the brief description provided in our course.

Provide the year when your knowledge would have been SoTA (for instance, if you last studied physics in 1980, then this year cannot be fresher than 1980).

The assessment of your current thinking mastery can take into account forgetting curves. If you excelled in a subject in 2010 and would have given yourself 10 points back then, but since then have not refreshed your mastery in that discipline, how many points remain for you?

In the end, calculate the average level of thinking mastery.

If necessary, make notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write your reflection on what came to mind when filling out the table. This way, you can more consciously approach forming a personal educational trajectory.

**Find the corresponding assignment by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
