title: 'Perform simulation: 7.6. Role, method, and work artifact'
---

Review the examples in the table. Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the examples. For the specified work artifact, it is sufficient to provide an example of one role. Providing full names is not necessary, or you can mention people you know. If your knowledge is insufficient to choose the required words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google, or consult known experts. List the last names of three of your colleagues and match them with the project roles they play in a particular work or personal project. Then list at least three of your project roles, methods, work artifacts.

If necessary, make notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write down a question to ask in support chat or record a thought for a future draft.
