title: Org units, services

Work is carried out by **org units**. An org unit is agents (people, organizations, AI) with materials and equipment at the disposal of these agents. The minimum org unit is one employee, hired for a specific title and managing the corresponding resources.

Most often, org units do not initiate work themselves. In collective activities, some org units have the authority to assign work to others, who have the duty to fulfill such requests. The entire set of org units with mutual authority forms an **organization**. A system of interest can be created by an extended enterprise, which may include several organizations. Thus, a legal or organizational-legal division is one of the possible descriptions of the creating system.

Each org unit carries out external behavior, which we call a **service**. For example, there is an org unit in an enterprise that accrues salaries, and there is an org unit that disburses it. These are the services of accrual and disbursement. There are also assembly services, such as car assembly. Org units may provide services to other org units or to the system of interest^[For example, car assembly service.].

Work arises when an org unit is given an assignment and receives the necessary resources. Then the org unit provides the necessary service, resulting in a **work artifact**. As long as there is no assignment or resources, the service is not provided or the work is not done.
