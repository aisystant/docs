title: Increment and Iteration
---

In a world of constant change and striving for perfection, the concepts of "iteration" and "increment" are key elements on the road to success. But what do they represent and why are they so important? Let's explore.

**Iteration is the process of repeating certain actions to approach the desired result.** An iteration can occur at a specific stage or coincide with it. In the context of product development (or creating systems), it means improving through constant hypothesis setting and testing (not necessarily on a predetermined cycle). Testing hypotheses through the principle "The more iterations, the more likely the success" underscores the importance of persistence and willingness to experiment.

In each iteration, we gain valuable experience that brings us closer to the goal. It is especially important in each iteration not to make a fatal mistake, as it can end future iterations or make them significantly more difficult.

**Increment is a small result of each iteration, a meaningful improvement.** It is the additional utility in the system of interest that we obtain after each attempt at improvements. In the context of creation, development, and product enhancement, incremental improvements ensure gradual but sustainable improvement with minimal risk of making a fatal mistake.

Why is this important?

All of this concerns the **principle of continuity**. Continuity means that work on the system does not end after its initial creation and commissioning. Instead, the system constantly adapts and improves in line with changing needs and circumstances. Continuous engineering^[In the context of systems engineering, continuity manifests through practices such as continuous integration and continuous delivery. Here, developers constantly make small changes that are tested and integrated into the system without major delays. This helps quickly identify and correct errors, ensuring the system's security and compliance with real operating conditions.] involves constant updating and upgrading various aspects of the system, whether it be software or physical components. This can include monthly or even daily updates that fix bugs, add new features, or adapt the system to new conditions.

Understanding and applying the principles of iteration and increment allows us to move forward more consciously and effectively. **Instead of striving for unattainable perfection immediately, we focus on gradual improvement.** This makes the development process less tedious and more productive. Each iteration brings new knowledge and experience, making the next step more meaningful.

To implement the principle of iteration and increment concerning a product, **it is necessary to focus on skill (both personal and team) that also needs to be continuously developed.** Many know about iteration and increment concerning a product, but few think about the conscious development of the skill of creating this product. Conscious development means improving the ability to learn quickly, think systematically, and do it professionally^[Developing one's personality is recommended to be undertaken in iterations and increments.].

This approach to iteration and increments in product and skill is not just a method; it is a philosophy of **continuous development and self-improvement.** They remind us that success is not an instantaneous event, but the result of continuous work.

In conclusion, the concepts of iteration and increment play a key role in achieving success in any area based on the principle of continuity. They teach us to value the process as much as the result, reminding us that every step forward, with attention to the product and our skill, even the smallest, brings us closer to our ultimate goal.
