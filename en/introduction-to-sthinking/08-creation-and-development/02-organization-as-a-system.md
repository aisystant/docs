title: Organization as a System
---

A business, like any system, can be viewed as a "black" and "transparent" box.

When we speak of a "black box," the organization can be viewed analogously to a "person" — as an **agent** playing a specific role. We can quite well say that the role of designer is played by Ivan Ivanovich or the design bureau of OAO "Mostproject." The "black box" draws attention to external or role behavior.

The "transparent box" draws attention to the mechanics of this "box." In a company, there are people organized with tools and resources, and this company provides certain **services** to others. This means that it's not someone from outside requesting a function, but the company itself offering a particular service externally, so "take it if you want, leave it if you don't." This can be a design bureau with a design service, an assembly shop with an assembly service, or a hairdresser with a haircut service. Thus, instead of the word enterprise (or organization), a more general term can be used — "orglink."

**Orglink** is not only an enterprise but also a department or an individual employee with their tools, or even a temporary team (working group). The organization itself is also composed of orglinks, but this is just one way to view the structure of an organization.

We can approach viewing the internal mechanics of an organization from the perspective of four main descriptions of the system as a "transparent box." We will not discuss here the relatively intuitive spatial and cost descriptions but will focus on the important **distinction** between **functional and modular decomposition for the organization system**.

Note the table presenting the main concepts and differences in functional and modular views of the organization.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Functional**                                                                               **Modular**
  **Orgroles:** manager, developer, accountant, **...**                                           **Orglinks**: department, section, employee with a title, working group, organization.
  **Function:** requested behavior from a functional part.                                      **Service:** behavior issued outward from a module.
  **Methods:** discipline and tools that allow creating a work artifact within a framework   **Methods:** managing resources, timelines, and roles to directly create a work artifact following appropriate methods.
  **Logical time:** stages with a sequence of methods.                                      **Physical time:** project phases with specific execution times.

**In a functional view** **we operate** **with concepts** **orgrole,** **method (practice), function, and, in this view, logical time.** This perspective helps understand how a business or holding (an expanded enterprise^[For example, a system of interest in a car or airplane is created not by one company but several.]) operates. Accordingly, it helps understand why there are chances (due to what) to create the system of interest. It's vital for us to understand into which roles an organization can be divided and by which methods the system of interest will be created. For example, when it comes to a new apartment building, we can highlight such functional parts of the system-creator as the designer, builder, manager. And who will perform these roles, whether an individual or an organization, is determined in the modular view.

**The modular view operates with concepts** **orglink,** **work** **and service, and the view deals with physical time.** In work, resources, executors, and timelines are important. Without these, roles and methods are useless, but on the other hand, work will be unconscious if there is no understanding of what methods are required and how they follow each other. Executors or orglinks perform methods using their tools. We can understand who and with what resources will conduct work in physical time. That is, what we do today, and what tomorrow.

For example, we can say that tomorrow Ivan will prepare the wall for painting using the cleaning method; for this, he was allocated a tool and 4 hours of work. And the day after tomorrow, a team of plasterers with their tools will implement putty and sanding methods.

Accordingly, just as a structure (module, physical object) is assigned to a role (functional object), one can similarly say that **work is assigned to** **a method.** In analogy with an engineering system, an organization's view first occurs through functional parts, and only then through modular ones. First, you need to understand what roles and methods are needed, and only then determine work, orglinks, and resources.
