title: Why and How to Explain What Systems Thinking Is
---

You have probably heard the famous quote by Ernest Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics and Nobel laureate: "If a scientist cannot explain to the cleaning lady in his laboratory the meaning of his work, then he himself does not understand what he is doing."

This quote raises an important question: why be able to explain systems thinking to ordinary people (colleagues, children, subscribers)? Isn't it just a waste of time and effort?

**Answers to these questions are a continuation of the educational program** in any subject and, accordingly, the continuation of your self-development, that is, the development of your personality as a system. Regardless of what you are studying or doing: physics, systems thinking, or AI, at first, you pay more attention to theory, and later focus more on practice. You might think you know many system concepts, principles, and thinking techniques, but with each new return to theory, you view what seems already learned with a new neural network and notice something unusual, deepening your understanding.

When you explain complex concepts to people, you revisit what you've learned and **test your knowledge on how to explain certain work or life situations**^[You kind of test your neural network's ability to explain the world, as systems thinking is also a worldview, the ability to look at the world.]. By explaining what systems thinking is to others, you:

- continue to layer knowledge (like a second coat of paint), as they say: "If you want to understand better yourself, explain it to another";
- better understand the meaning of your activities, increase your agency, and understand why you invest so much time in complex knowledge. This means you constantly ground yourself;
- literally start creating like-minded people among your close ones^[Especially feel that close ones have a worldview similar to yours.] and colleagues (saturate them), and can implement work and personal projects with them in the future;
- engage in enlightenment and make the world a better place if you post on social media about your experience and popularize systems thinking.

Here is one of the **explanations of systems thinking as a worldview** that you can adopt.

When you enter an apartment, you quickly orient yourself in the setting. You have certain terminology to see a lot yourself or ask the necessary questions. You know what a kitchen is, how a bath differs from a shower, what a shared apartment is, etc. Therefore, you can make many decisions whether you are a buyer or seller, tenant or guest, manager or plumber.

Similarly, systems thinking helps to quickly understand any human activity and understand what is what and how everything is interconnected. And for example, who are the hypothetical "sellers," "realtors," or "burglars" there. In other words, systems thinking is a "prism" through which workplace projects, your enterprise, or your life can be viewed. And not only viewed but also changed.

This "prism" or worldview does not appear in a few months. Our brain literally needs to grow new connections. However, if you study relevant courses and apply this knowledge in real life, systems thinking is instilled faster compared to the overall time unconsciously spent on real estate market knowledge. And even though you know a lot about this market, you are still probably less informed than a professional. Many know their work activities, but it's unlikely it's a systemic outlook.

Fluent systems thinking works just like any worldview. For example, you come to a new enterprise, but you understand everything there, just like in an apartment. However, knowledge about apartments doesn't mean you can easily do renovations or install new windows. Similarly, systems thinking is not a panacea, and practical methods are needed besides it. But you will already know that for "new windows," you need to call some suppliers, and for "installing an exhaust," others. For you, any enterprise activity is conceptually marked, just like any apartment.

With a high probability, many adults understand how to renovate an apartment and where to start: what to do first, and what follows. And if needed, anyone could easily write three to five paragraphs on what to pay attention to in any apartment or how to renovate it. Thus, a systems person understands where to look first, and as they progress through the main AISYSTANT program --- learns how to change any system and activity for the better. This way, one becomes the director of self-development, family or team enterprise, and possibly, in the future, community and society.

Hopefully, you can better understand the brief description in the first subsection "How systems thinking helps in work activities." Based on this text and your experience, you can create your own **personal explanations of what systems thinking is.** This way, you will infinitely improve in the mastery of systems thinking.
