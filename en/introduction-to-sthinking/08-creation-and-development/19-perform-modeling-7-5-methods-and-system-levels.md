title: 'Perform simulation: 7.5. Methods and Systems Levels'
---

Fill in the "Method" column based on the following description: "Peter will need to make many presentations with product demonstrations in the next six months. He is well-versed in the product he will be presenting but doesn't feel very confident in delivering his public speeches. He has broken down his speech into systems levels. Help him find a method for each systems level so he can select some training courses for them."

If necessary, make notes for further refinement. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat or record a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.**
