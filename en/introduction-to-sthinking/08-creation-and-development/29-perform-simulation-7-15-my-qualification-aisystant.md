Refer to the example in the first row of the table. In the "Life Mastery" column, evaluate your current life mastery on a 10-point scale. Life mastery is calculated as the average of the sum of thinking mastery and practical mastery. The thinking mastery score is calculated as the average in the “Level of Thinking Mastery” table, and the practical mastery score as the average in the “My Roles, Methods, and Priority Projects” table.

Note your current AISYSTANT qualification and the year you obtained it. Also, note the years you obtained previous qualifications to assess progress. In the column "What needs to be done to get the next qualification," describe your self-development plans.

Be aware that unused knowledge is forgotten, so it's important to regularly confirm your qualifications. It is not necessary to do this within AISYSTANT, but we would appreciate it if you share the results of your work and personal projects on AISYSTANT's public platforms. This will be sufficient for updating and granting a new qualification.

The highest qualification, "Agent," implies that you can find new challenges for yourself, create successful systems that change the world for the better, and you live a happy, successful, and interesting life.
