The course "Introduction to Systems Thinking" will help you take the first step into fascinating systems thinking. In the course, you will become familiar with the **basic concepts** of systems thinking and begin to apply them to work and personal projects.

You can take the "Introduction to Systems Thinking" course **independently or as part of group learning with an instructor**. If you enroll in the course with an instructor, you will receive feedback on all your questions and homework checks. The instructor will draw attention to numerous pitfalls, help understand complex moments, and also accelerate your understanding of the challenging systems thinking.

The course consists of 7 sections^[We strongly recommend arming yourself with a pen or taking notes on the computer while reading. It has been proven that if you consume information while simultaneously noting arising ideas and questions, learning becomes much more effective.] and 7 homework assignments (hereinafter referred to as HA) that must be completed based on personal life examples and work projects. In each HA, practice thinking through writing^[Thinking through writing is the main method of learning a complex methodology: if you don't write, you probably aren't learning. If you complete HA in writing, it means you are engaging and developing your intelligence.] and publish a draft (post) in the AISYSTANT club as a result. In the draft, use notes and drafts that you write in the process of studying the course.

It is **recommended** to **definitely** **model** using appropriate tables when completing homework. This work acts as a simulator of systems thinking. The setup of systems thinking occurs through:

- learning the theory (concepts, principles, thinking techniques), which is presented in the course "Introduction to Systems Thinking";
- modeling based on examples given in the homework;
- modeling on several of your own real projects that you will predominantly implement within the second semester.

Each homework assignment contains several **modeling exercises in the form of template tables** that need to be filled out based on the given examples. The table-template headers are meta-meta-models ("from the textbook") for describing some project activity, and the contents of the filled tables are usually meta-models or models (from some applied subject area). By filling out the template tables, you engage in modeling.

Virtually all template tables are divided into the following blocks:

- an example of completing the table, which you must carefully study by paying attention to the connection of systems thinking concepts in the table header with specific life examples;
- an assignment to fill in the missing cells based on the example;
- an assignment for modeling a work project;
- an assignment for modeling a personal life project (for example, for systems such as body, teeth, abs, workspace, etc.).

In the course "Introduction to Systems Thinking" with an instructor, you will study the corresponding online course, model simple personal and work projects in tables, and also receive feedback from the instructor. As a result of the course, it is advisable to write a final systems essay.

Systems thinking is no simpler than mathematical analysis. However, even the most unremarkable student managed to cope with it due to certain self-development practices. Therefore, within the course, each student will have to **carry out the following independent work**:

- organize systematic slow reading of each section of the online course and additional literature for a week (it's better to do this daily, not reading everything in one day) and make educational notes^[On the Aisystant platform, educational notes are automatically sent to the club where they can be compiled into drafts and later write a draft post, also published in the club];
- consistently implement the practice of thinking through writing in the process of completing HA and write 8 drafts (one for each of the seven sections and a final draft about completing the course);
- change your current schedule, allocating 10-15 hours a week for 2 months to study the course^[If a comfortable and unhurried pace is important to you: cover one section a week. If you have more time, you can complete the course faster. However, it is recommended to allocate at least a month to complete the course to thoughtfully complete all HA.], and also adhere to a daily routine during this time^[If you do not change your schedule and, for example, do not get enough rest and sleep, lead a healthy lifestyle, you may not have enough strength for complex intellectual work];
- keep constant track of the time invested in learning according to the schedule and the allocated slots for each day of the week.

Pay **attention and to** **personal** **organization**: systematic completion of HA, planning, and accounting for learning time. It is important to keep attention on the total amount of time invested to get used to complex learning and see initially positive results in the form of a completed plan for time investment in the course^[The substantial result in work projects and life overall will appear later. You will need to hold on until you receive it. Focusing attention on time investment will help achieve results.]. After this, you will have a deeper understanding of the essence of the systems methodology.

During the course, it will be useful for you to expand your activeness by learning the names of roles, methods, systems, and work artifacts in various fields of activity. You have a decent activeness in anatomy (system "organism"), but you probably know less about the concepts used in entrepreneurship, engineering, or management. Systems thinking is not a desk job; you will need to communicate a lot with different people! Do not postpone this to the future, start right away. For instance, write, call, or have a conversation over a cup of coffee with colleagues or friends. Additionally, **use our** **AI bot** **Aisystant,** **ChatGPT** **and** **Google**.

I hope your first step into systems thinking will be fruitful, and you will discover a world of methodology that literally changes worldview and life.

**To complete your homework, use your personal work space for modeling:**
