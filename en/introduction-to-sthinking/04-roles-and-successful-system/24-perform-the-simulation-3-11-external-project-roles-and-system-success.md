title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.11. External Project Roles and System Success'
---

List at least 15 external roles of different people in your current project and their interests. Remember that one person can play multiple roles, so try to list all the roles of that person. Rate your expectation (on a ten-point scale) for meeting their preferences upon project completion. If necessary, take notes for further elaboration. For example, in the "Notes" column, you can write a question to ask in the support chat, or jot down a thought for future preparation.

**Find the corresponding assignment in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.**
