title: “Role” and “method”
---

When we consider project roles, we necessarily associate them with practices (methods). We will further use the terms method and practice as synonyms. In Systems Thinking, the term "method" is not used in the same way as it is in everyday language^[For example, when discussing the contrast between theory and practice.]. We need this concept to discuss the formal description of the actions of project roles. Project roles operate according to a **method** (**practice)**, each role can perform many of them, through which work artifacts are created. For instance, a swimmer can swim in various styles (often the word “style” is a synonym for method and practice, and is also referred to as technique) – freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly, etc.

There are methods of a surgeon, dentist, entrepreneur, engineer, marketer, etc. People study applied methods (practices) to more effectively create work artifacts. Be sure to list the methods you consciously use, and then add the **work artifacts** that you produce with their help.

In the course of your work, you apply various methods to create work artifacts. At the same time, you might be engaged in either analytical or engineering work. In the first case, you create **internal work artifacts**, that is, something for yourself. For example, you draft your plans, analyze completed work, or collect data. In the second case, you create **external work artifacts**, which you deliver to other people. In this case, unlike the first, your decisions change the surrounding world.

Pay attention to how much time you spend as an analyst and how much as an engineer. In the evening, compile or recall a list of created external and internal work artifacts^[For more details on how to increase personal efficiency, you can find out in the “Self-Development Practices” course.].
