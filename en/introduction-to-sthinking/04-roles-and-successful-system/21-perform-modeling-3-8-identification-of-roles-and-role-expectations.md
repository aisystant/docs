title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.8. Identifying Roles and Role Expectations'
---

Familiarize yourself with the example in the first row of the table. Note that a well-formulated action implies a role. Some roles are culturally conditioned and are widely used. Try to find them, use ChatGPT or Google for this, or consult familiar experts. Interview three of your colleagues and fill in the next three rows. Systems thinking is not desk work; you will need to communicate a lot with different people! Don't postpone this for the future; start today. For example, write, call, or talk over coffee with colleagues. Do not record information about colleagues that you already know!

Then fill in the row for yourself. Use the practice of thinking through writing. Start describing your activities in some way, and then revise. Write a draft about this in the AISYSTANT blog.

**Find the corresponding task in the modeling workspace by number and complete all its points.**
