title: 'Perform Modeling: 3.5. Roles Performed by the Manager'
---

Refer to the example in the first row of the table. Record at least three roles for your manager that you know they have performed in the past few months (if possible, arrange them in the order they were performed). Don't forget roles such as "strategist," "leader," "organizer," and other managerial and entrepreneurial roles, as well as roles of organizational engineers (technical engineers, unlike enterprise engineers, often don't consider this work, but it is workâ€”it requires skill and considerable time and other resources). If you lack the insight to find the right words and designations, use ChatGPT or Google or consult with familiar experts.

Record the roles you perform in the title of a leader in a work or personal project. If you think you are not a manager anywhere, that's a mistake. If necessary, use letter writing to reflect on this issue.
