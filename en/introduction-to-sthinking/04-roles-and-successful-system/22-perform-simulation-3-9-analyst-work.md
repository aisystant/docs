title: 'Perform Modelling: 3.9. Analyst's Work'
---

Remember how an analyst differs from an engineer. Enter the percentage of time you spend on analytical work and the percentage of time you spend on engineering work:

- Doing something that does not lead to your decisions being accepted by others without additional questions -- creating internal work artifacts;
- Changing the surrounding world with your decisions, where everyone understands that these are your decisions, your responsibility, and they do not interfere -- creating external work artifacts.

Record these figures in a table: it is advisable to extract these figures from your Pomodoro exocortex. You can separately divide work and personal projects.

**Find the corresponding task in the workspace for modelling by number and complete all its points.**
