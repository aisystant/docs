title: Theatrical Metaphor
---

To understand what a "role" is, let's turn to theater. Everyone knows the phrase "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." This phrase bears not only philosophical recognition, but it's also useful in systems thinking.

The theatrical metaphor helps explain the difference between action and the performer of the action, or between **role and role performer**^[Do not think that I am a set of roles. I am a performer of a specific role in a specific situation or project. But I also possess the skills to play many different roles.]**.** In theater, they distinguish the performer Vladimir Vysotsky^[The role of Hamlet may be performed by Ivan Ivanovich, whose performance pales in comparison to Vysotsky's talent. However, both performers still play the role of Hamlet, even though they have different qualifications. Therefore, we will separately discuss roles and performers. The role is the same, but performers can be different.] and the role he plays. Even small children understand this. But adults sometimes do not realize that they play roles as "manager" or "engineer."

In theater, the same actor can play different roles, and anyone's actions can be viewed from the perspective of a "role." One might say that everyone plays roles in personal life or work projects. However, not everyone thinks about this.

**We consciously pay attention to our actions only** **when we want to improve our behavior**. If we don't need to change anything in our thinking or work practices, there's no need for role consideration. However, if it's important for us to change the working principle of an individual or entire team, the best option today is to use the concept of "role" and other related concepts such as "method (practice)" and "work artifact."

In theater, actions according to the role are clearly defined by the script, and performers can change regularly. Life is similar: the role of a surgeon can be played by different people. But any surgeon acts based on certain medical practices studied in university. The concept of "role" is inseparable from "method (practice)": as soon as we move into role consideration, we must also discuss role practices^[As well as work artifacts, systems, and much more. Systems thinking introduces certain concepts and shows how they are interconnected.].

So, **role**^[The concept of "role" has synonyms -- role or functional object.] is a well-established cultural name: surgeon, football player, driver, hammer^[Remember the "hammer" consideration from the previous section.] or car, etc. A specific agent, called the **role performer**, plays the role. From the theatrical metaphor and human-actor, we move to a more fundamental consideration where not only people but other agents (for example, artificial intelligence, or a team, or an entire enterprise) or any inanimate object (even a stone) can be role performers.

The agent's actions by role are **role behavior**,** which is performed according to specific rules or using a specific **method (practice).** Role performers create **work artifacts** using practices. Let's examine the following in more detail:

- The concept of role is not only related to humans, although we started analyzing it through the theatrical metaphor;
- Roles are not with a person, but a person in a role participates in some activity (process) or is part of a system;
- A role performer does not have to be a human, so we'll talk about an agent as a role performer or about an inanimate object;
- Agents can be both people and inanimate systems;
- The roles and their interests affect the system's success;
- Roles perform practice and create work artifacts.
