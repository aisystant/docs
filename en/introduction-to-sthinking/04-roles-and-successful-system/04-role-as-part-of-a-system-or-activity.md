title: Role as Part of a System or Activity
---

As you already know, the concept of "role" does not only refer to a person. The performer of a role can be not only a person but even a "stone." Now we will go further and say that roles do not belong to a person, as is usually thought. In systems thinking, a role is considered **as part of a system or activity.**

A role is designated as a **functional object.** The concept of a "functional object" is related to the consideration of a "system": when we say^[When we operate with word-concepts, we manage attention. Each concept "highlights" something special. We can't consider the world as a whole, and it's hard to fully consider even a system, as we lack computational power. But we can consider something specific from the entire system. For example, an item of interest is cost. Even so, the concept of an "item of interest" is linked to the whole system, and discussing one thing doesn't make us lose connection with the whole.] that some system interests us as a functional object, it means we are interested not in the physical embodiment but specifically in the role (or functional) behavior of the system.

For example, we previously talked about the role of a hammer, and therefore considered separately the physical object and the system, which are called by one word â€” "hammer." And if we needed the role of a "hammer," it means there is some supersystem or process where the function of driving nails is needed.

We can, of course, consider the physical object (even a person) and say that it can play certain roles. For example, a stone can play the role of a hammer or a paperweight, and a person can play the role of a manager or a driver. However, we do not say that the role of a hammer or paperweight is inside or part of the stone. Similarly, **we will not say that the role of a manager, driver, or father is inside a person.**

Whenever we talk about a role, we must, in the next step, think about **what this role should be considered a part of and what method it implements to produce a specific work artifact.** And if it's a matter of a system (not a project), we can talk about role or functional division. For instance, a driver is part of the system "driver+car."

We can **discuss the system from different perspectives, and one such consideration is functional or role-based.** In it, we pay attention to the fact that the system is a functional object, meaning it plays a certain role. And this is the primary consideration of the system as a "black box." This approach means we are interested not in the design of the system but in its role behavior.

The system as a **"black box"** delivers role (functional) behavior as if externally, while the system as a **"transparent box"** focuses our attention on how it is constructed internally. You will learn about the consideration of a system as a "transparent box" in section 6 "System Modeling."
