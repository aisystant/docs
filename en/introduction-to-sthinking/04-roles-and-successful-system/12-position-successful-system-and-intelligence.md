Alongside the concept of role, terms such as title, rank, and qualification are used. They help to better describe human activity.

**Qualification and rank are characteristics of the role performer.** Qualification indicates the skill level of a person in performing a specific role. This evaluation is given by an organization, community, or state. A rank is assigned by competent bodies and reflects a person's position in a specific hierarchy established by these bodies. For example, in science, in the military, in computer games, etc. In AISYSTANT, there is also its own qualification^[[https://system-school.ru/qualification](https://system-school.ru/qualification){target="_blank"}] and 8 qualification levels.

**Title** **determines the ability and obligation to play certain roles, as well as** **assigns** **powers for resource management** (money, performers' time). For example, job descriptions list duties that can be understood as obligations to play some roles and the possibility to play others. Personnel and job documents also specify what financial, material, and human resources a person can manage in a particular title. A person is appointed to a title and signs respective documents regarding their rights and obligations. For example, appointed as the manager of an enterprise.

A layperson would say that after being appointed to a title, a person is obliged to follow job instructions, whereas from a systems thinking perspective, **in a title, a person has the opportunity and obligation to play respective roles and manage certain resources**.

**Enterprise manager is a title** that obliges a person to at least play the roles of manager and leader. They are responsible for the enterprise's resources. And they have the opportunity to play any role in their enterprise. Who can forbid them?^[Some managers use this opportunity and centralize decision-making. Thus, they play all roles themselves, and employees only prepare documents but do not make decisions in their professional roles, not putting 'skin in the game.' Imagine a surgeon going to the chief doctor during surgery to get approval on where to make an incision.]

Thus, an enterprise employee can be viewed from several perspectives:

- functional consideration – role, role actions, methods;
- organizational consideration – title, subordination and leadership, resource management, organization, and task execution.

A person-agent in a title^[And, accordingly, having the right and/or obligation to fulfill certain roles] with certain resources (financial, technological, etc.) is the minimal **organizational link.** Organizational links also include subdivisions: departments, divisions, holding enterprise units.

When designing organizations, **organizational places** are identified: titles and positions in the staffing schedule (in organizational charts), vacancies, etc. This reveals the structure of subordination of some organizational places to others. When a person-agent occupies an organizational place, an organizational link appears. **Organization** is an organized group of people who understand their powers, subordination, roles, and resource responsibility.
