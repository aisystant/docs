title: 'Perform modeling: 3.3. Role, performer, rank, and title'
---

Review the example in the first row of the table. Pay attention to the differences between the concepts of "role" and "title", "rank" and "qualification". Fill in the empty cells in the rows after the example. Recall the full names of people you know who match these descriptions. If you lack the breadth of knowledge to choose the right words and designations (names), use ChatGPT or Google or talk to familiar experts. Describe your colleagues from work and personal projects.  

If necessary, make notes when refilling the template tables. You can record a reflection and the result of the work on mistakes.
