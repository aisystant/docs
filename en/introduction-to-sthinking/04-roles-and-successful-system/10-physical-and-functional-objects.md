title: Physical and Functional Objects
---

Let's understand **how a role differs from a project role**.

A project role is always filled by a person or agent, not by a stone, which has no intention. The concept of a "role" can be used not only in relation to an agent. After all, a role is a functional object, and its performer is some physical object. This object can be either an agent or a non-agent without intention.

Consider the example of a taxi. In a taxi, the driver role can be fulfilled by a human or a robot with artificial intelligence (here is a subtle moment, and possibly soon we might be talking about AI intentions). In the first case, we refer to a project role to emphasize human involvement. But if we say "there is a driver role in the taxi," we assume that the performer of this role can be either a human or an inanimate object.

It is important to understand the division into:

- **Physical object**: this is a person, AI, or another inanimate item. Note that when we talk about a physical object, we mean something existing in the physical world. We do not know what role this physical object might perform^[There is simply a stone. This is a typical physical object. Its function is not clear at all. And if someone wants to do something, they need a specific function. For example, if they need to hammer a nail or weigh down papers lying on a table so they don't fly away. Then we are not talking about a stone, but about functional objects - a hammer and a paperweight. The fact that it is a stone is no longer as important.]. The main thing is that we know, when calling it a physical object, that it exists in a 4D dimension (three-dimensional space and time).
- **Functional object**: this is the role. In the above example, it's the driver's role. When we talk about a functional object, we focus on the fact that there is not just a physical object, but a role. That is, not just a person, but a driver with certain skills. In this consideration, we are interested in the behavior of this functional object, not what physical object will play this role^[Combining the physical object with the functional will be necessary when creating the system, but we need to be able to separately focus on these two entities with our attention and able to talk about them separately.];
- **Role or functional behavior**. We say that a functional object has certain role or functional behavior, meaning the system is viewed as a "black box"^[Here we are not concerned with the internal arrangement. The arrangement of the system (as a transparent box) will be detailed in section 6 "System Modeling".]. For example, for the driver's role, this behavior is called driving the car.

Such a division into **physical object, functional object (role), and role behavior** is an important technique of systems thinking.

For example, first, we understand that we need a nail-driving function. **Function is behavior**. This function is tied to the role of "nail driver," and then a performer is assigned to this role. It won't necessarily be the physical object hammer^[Remember, in culture, instead of "nail driver," they say "hammer". In fact, the term "hammer" has become culturally-bound, meaning it is as widely used as the term "driver." In culture, some terms are constantly fixed for functional objects. No need to say vehicle driver, you can simply say -- driver. Similarly, no need to say "nail driver," you can just say -- hammer. That is, the hammer is a functional object, and the physical object is a stone, microscope, or hammer. But here the hammer is implied as a specific tool as a physical object.], which is lying in my garage. The necessary role of "nail driver" can be played by this microscope in the laboratory or the stone I see from my window^[Here it is specially emphasized that we are talking about specific objects -- microscope and stone, and not some abstract specimens.].

Engineers design systems in the same way. First, they understand what functions are needed and, based on this function-behavior, name the system, that is, give it a functional name or role. Then they determine the modules or physical objects that best fit these functional roles.

The role approach is the same for an agent and for a "hardware" inanimate system if we consider them as performers of certain roles. For the agent, the behavior is called **role behavior**, and for the "hardware" system -- the system function. Although it is not incorrect to talk about the role behavior of the car.

However, there are deeper differences. For example, a person needs to be persuaded to take on a certain role in some way, whereas you don't need to persuade a microscope to play the role of hammer^[More precisely, all "persuasions" are prescribed in formal engineering methods. If the calculations are made correctly, the hardware system is unable to evade fulfilling the assigned role.]. Therefore, in systems with people, **the practice of leadership** comes to the forefront, which consists of getting a person to step into a role at the right moment and perform it well, efficiently, and with pleasure. A leader knows how to position a person in a role. The method of systems leadership is about helping another person take on a specific role. Setting "hardware" systems into a role occurs using ordinary engineering methods and based on physical theories.

For example, a person in the role of a manager may impose a penalty on a subordinate for failing to complete an assignment during a meeting, all within the framework of managerial practice. However, this same person in the role of a leader may have a heart-to-heart conversation in the evening to understand what issues the subordinate faced.

Another difference is that a "hardware" system does not have a role interest, it is only present in the project role. To create a successful system, interested project roles are first identified, and then their role interests. Human behavior is conditioned by the concept of **"intention,"** and a role has **"preference."**
