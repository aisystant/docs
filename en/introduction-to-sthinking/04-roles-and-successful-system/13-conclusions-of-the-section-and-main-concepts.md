The concept of "role" helps humanity better describe the physical world and model human actions. "Role" is related to action, and an agent is the executor of the role. Furthermore, one can separately discuss the skills and qualifications of the executor, as well as separately discuss and improve the role actions needed within a team.

It can be said that "role" is a mental model that helps study and improve an agent's behavior. The concepts of "role," "system of interest," and "role interests" (preferences) determine a successful system.

Humanity accumulates knowledge about actions regardless of who currently performs this role. And this knowledge, together with tools, is referred to as a method (practice). With certain methods (practices), roles create work artifacts.
