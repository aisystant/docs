title: Systems Approach 3.0

**In the first generation of systems thinking**, systems were considered "objective," not subjective, meaning that numerous stakeholders were not taken into account. For example, a chair, hammer, or car are systems understood by everyone; they have a clear purpose (role and function), and only that was considered. Such clarity allowed modeling only the most important aspects formally^[Without paying due attention to a large number of other interests and interactions.], and therefore, textbooks of the first generation of systems thinking are full of formulas, numbers, and the like.

At the end of the last century and in the 2010s, **the second generation of systems thinking** prevailed, which differed from its predecessor in that it considered systems not as objective but as subjective. Numerous stakeholders emerged. And the understanding that systems do not exist by themselves but arise when needed by someone. Remember how earlier in section 2, we discussed the system "hammer" and its difference from the physical object called "hammer." Moreover, in the first generation, systems were created as if by themselves, while in the second, they are made by people.

In the 2020s, a noticeable number of works began to emerge that can be attributed to **the third generation of systems thinking**. Our Intelligence Stack also relies on and develops these modern trends. The main principles of the third generation:

- **Scale-independence**, meaning the same approach and reasoning apply to objects of different scales, from small parts to entire systems, or from superstrings to the universe;
- **De-anthropomorphism**, meaning not emphasizing humans as anything mandatory, so we talk about agents with different levels of consciousness, memory, modeling capacity, and varying computational power for planning actions;
- **Multilevel evolution**, meaning it addresses not only genes but also memes, overcoming numerous problems and inconsistencies between system levels, and leading to ethics in decision-making;
- **Continuous development**^[Particularly applied in systems engineering and more fully explored in the corresponding course. This principle includes advanced generative modeling, good documentation, configuration management, and system modularity. Development occurs incrementally with small and rapid changes to adapt to constantly changing conditions. The main goal of continuous development is long-term success and maintaining achieved results.]**,** meaning system (product) development never ends and continues constantly, considering changes in the environment at different system levels and problems arising during development (including in the organization of development).

The third generation of the systems approach envisions a scale-independent world of systems, not a "human world," where these systems continuously develop and are always in process. In this development process (and sometimes destruction), **inconsistencies (frustrations)** between system levels are involved, and conflicts occur between all levels (system and creation chains).

Systems at different system levels try to maintain stability and develop, but this contradicts the desires for stability and development of systems at the same or other system levels. For example, countries may go to war with each other or collapse internally due to disagreements at the level of individual communities and interest groups. Moreover, during evolution, meta-systemic transitions often occur because of **inevitable inconsistencies between system levels**. As a result, only some configurations of systems survive, those that most accurately solve the problem of multilevel (not single-level!) optimization.

Note that these principles of the third generation systems approach can be discussed considering the concepts introduced in this section. For example, **it is impossible to consider only one system level**^[This is fraught with a fatal mistake.]**,** you have to think and, if necessary, cooperate with other teams working at other system levels. Successful systems are those where the satisfaction of interests (optimization of conflicts and inconsistencies) occurs immediately between different levels, even those we do not know about. At the very least, one should always try to learn about all inconsistencies.

You will study the third generation of systems thinking in more detail in the "Systems Thinking" course.
