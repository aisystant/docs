title: Project Activity and the Three Main Activity Roles
---

In the previous section, we focused on the system of interest, while the other systems seemed auxiliary. However, this does not mean that in project activity we only create or develop it. Practically **in any activity** **or** **project employees**^[This refers to people as agents or as role performers.] **can be part of teams of various** **subprojects** **and be creators of a wide variety of systems** (our systems and systems of creation). For example, Team No.1 creates a car engine, while another Team No.2 is engaged in developing the skills of Team No.1 members. Team No.3 works on the car assembly line, and Team No.4 is involved in creating and developing this conveyor. In all four teams, employees of the car manufacturer, and one and the same person can be a member of several teams.

To deal with the project or all teams and their subprojects within the extended enterprise, we need to:

- employ a simplified meta-meta-model "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" to review the project for creating the system of interest that ties together various roles and systems;
- introduce additional concepts of "areas of interest," "creation chains," and "system levels."

The "3x3 Table. Areas of Interest" (hereinafter referred to as the 3x3 Table) presented below shows **the connection between areas of interest of the three main roles** (subject areas of roles) **and areas of interest of the three main systems**. This tabular representation is a separate mental technique that offers a way to segment the activities of an enterprise (organization). In systems engineering, you will be presented with another way of looking at the creation and development of systems, as well as different role names for cases involving enterprise, clientele, personality, etc.

In every system area of interest, there are interests of all main roles â€” entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. And these interests are backed by corresponding roles. Rows of the 3x3 Table are areas of interest of the three main systems, and columns are areas of interest of the three main roles. Each cell is simply an area of interest.

Each cell of the 3x3 Table is the **subject** **of interest** **of a certain role in a** **certain** **system**. In other words, the role is interested in this system not in everything, but only in what concerns it. For example, an entrepreneur interested in the system of interest and everything related to it is called a visionary. Similarly, you can read all the other cells of the 3x3 Table.
