title: Meta-system transition and emergence
---

The multi-level nature of systemic decomposition is fundamental. At the very top level of any such breakdown lies potentially the universe, and at the very bottom level — superstrings^[or other known smallest scale physical objects]. However, the vast majority of people work at the middle level, while peripheral levels are predominantly occupied by scientists.

For our activities, a small range of systemic levels is important, which is commensurate with our life interests, although probably someone will work at the level of humanity and the nano level. Most will be interested in several systemic levels similar to those related to a car. Only in your case, it may be an IT program, a bridge, or skill.

**Note: crossing a systemic level changes everything,** meaning the titles of systems, roles, etc. Some roles are involved in using cars and discuss who will drive where. Others look at car parts and think about how to increase the efficiency of different parts. Third roles say nothing about the car but simply manufacture standardized parts. Fourth will talk about the materials from which car parts are made. And so on. This is an interesting technique of systemic thinking that helps to understand any complex subject activity.

All these roles perform different methods, speak different languages: in some roles, the language mainly reflects the car environment and its use problems; in others — production aspects of car creation and assembly; and in third ones — challenges related to material strength, processing difficulty, etc.

When working with a car, terms like "movement, journey," and so on are regularly used, but the materials from which the car is created are absolutely not mentioned. And if we go a level lower, we will already be talking about engine efficiency. And what about another level lower? Completely different people deal with the material: strength, friction, and everything else.

And all this is reflected in the speech of project roles that work at each systemic level. Transitioning from discussing one systemic level to another is the so-called **meta-system** **transition**. For a systemic thinker, the meta-system transition is literally heard in conversation and noticed in text! One of the techniques of systemic thinking is the ability to keep attention in a conversation on the systemic level being discussed. The fact is that professional communication can address several systemic levels simultaneously.

The main thing in the communication of experienced specialists is not the skillful juggling of professional terms, but the fluidity of the meta-system transition. **A professional understands an emergent property** at each systemic level well. For someone with systemic thinking, discussion is not just a flow of terms; they literally hear or read concepts from different systemic levels and understand the connection between different systemic levels and areas of interest.
