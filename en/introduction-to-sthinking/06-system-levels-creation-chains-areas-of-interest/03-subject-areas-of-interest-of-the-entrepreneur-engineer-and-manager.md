title: Subject Areas of Interest for the Entrepreneur, Engineer, and Manager
---

Let's explore in more detail three subject areas of interests and discuss the interests of the three main roles — entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the so-called **activity roles**, which are widely recognized in the culture (there are textbooks written about them, and they are relatively easy to identify) and through which other roles can be explained (they serve as a meta-model for other roles).

For example, you are well-versed in medicine and know many roles within the "doctors" class. An adult has a decent activity horizon in medicine. However, if you want to create successful systems and/or aspire to career growth, you also need to understand the roles and work artifacts of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. The activity role of a doctor can also be explained through these three major roles. For instance, the role of a dentist is an engineering role in a tooth treatment project, and the chief physician is a title where a person is likely to perform the role of a manager among other duties.

**Three** **subject** **areas of interest** **of these roles** **constitute the minimum work** **(activity)** **horizon of a modern person**. Whatever your title or roles may be, you need to understand the subjects of interest of the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager at a general level in a specific project or enterprise.

This horizon is important for everyone, because **we all** **perform, in one way or another,** **the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager** even in personal projects. Where to study or invest time, how to develop oneself or a child into a doer, how to manage resources? Everyone regularly answers these questions.

Let's once again focus on the 3x3 Table and examine it through the lens of the three main roles. Notice that, for example, a chef in a borscht cooking project acts as an activity role — engineer, but his subject area is not limited to the system borscht, as he might be interested in the presentation of the dish to the eater, kitchen space, ingredients, utensils, etc. Thus, the engineer is interested not only in the system of interest but also in others. Based on this, we can identify general descriptions of subjects of interest, roles, and work artifacts for each cell of the table.

**The entrepreneur** is interested in how to earn from eliminating someone's dissatisfaction, doing so continuously (now and in the future). The "entrepreneurs" class has specific interests and corresponding roles:

-   Promoter (including educator, marketer, sales) --- an entrepreneur interested in the external environment (market, opportunities) or supersystem, including clientele and their dissatisfactions;
-   Visionary (strategist) --- an entrepreneur interested in the demand (profitability of sales) of a specific system of interest now and in the future;
-   Businessman (founder) --- an entrepreneur interested in the attractiveness of the enterprise producing the system of interest.

**The engineer** is interested in the system of interest, which should change the world for the better. The "engineers" class has specific interests and corresponding roles:

-   Product owner --- an engineer interested in modeling and documenting usage scenarios of the system of interest within the supersystem;
-   System engineer --- an engineer interested in creating a successful system of interest (one-off), considering all stakeholders. Roles in the "engineers" class can include architects and developers;
-   Development organizer (DevOps, development platform technologist, method manager) --- an engineer interested in the functional capability of the enterprise (creating systems) to produce the system of interest, including in the necessary quantity.

**The manager** is interested in creating systems that should produce the systems of interest, and importantly, in the necessary quantity (not just one):

-   Environmental relations manager (PR, GR, etc.) --- a manager interested in considering external stakeholders relative to the enterprise, including the company's image, managing communications with various stakeholders, such as investors and the public;
-   Operational manager --- a manager or work organizer interested in creating and delivering the system of interest on time and within budget. They organize existing people to perform appropriate roles in a pre-planned enterprise;
-   Administrator --- a manager interested in the operability and readiness for work of all enterprise systems, including qualified employees, necessary resources (working capital), and reliable tools (technologies).

**The team workflow logic** can be explained as follows:

1.  First, the entrepreneur determines a group of potential clients and their problems (target group). Then they understand how these problems can be solved and define a possible system of interest. They also find resources to organize business activities;
2.  Then a systems engineer^[In roles like developer, architect, etc.] connects, identifying the needs of project roles and devises the design of the system of interest, which should solve the problems identified by the entrepreneur's target group;
3.  After that, the manager creates and manages the enterprise that should produce the necessary quantity of the system of interest to solve the problems of the target group, as well as informs all external project roles about how their interests are being considered.

Regardless of your role or the title you hold, it is advisable to understand the areas of interest of systems and the subject areas of the three major roles. You should be able to think about all of this together and, if necessary, separately, by managing your attention.
