title: Areas of Interest
---

In section 3, we were already introduced to the concept of an area of interest. Several related characteristics or areas of interest can be grouped into an **area of concern**. These different areas of interests are the focus of attention for specific roles in the project. Since there are quite a few areas of interest, for convenience, they can be grouped into specific areas.

A systems thinker assumes that **each role wants to know** (predicts) how its preference will be considered. Therefore, roles whose areas of interest are to be satisfied must be provided with responses to these concerns to assess the feasibility of preferences.

Responses to each role's concerns are **descriptions in the form of documentation (models).** Models are created only for the areas of interest and preferences that are decided to be satisfied. However, not every preference necessarily corresponds to one model. Typically, they are compiled not by preferences but by areas or even areas of interest that the team decided to satisfy. For example, to address the concerns of the roles of seller and buyer, a "budget estimate" model is prepared.

Since multiple systems are simultaneously considered in the project, not just the system of interest, there will be many models in the project. All these models need to be interconnected. Before their creation, it will be necessary to decide which models to create. For example, besides the estimate for the system of interest, an expert assessment or another description can be made, and the project will also require a team maintenance budget (salary fund) as a description of the creating system.

Therefore, **areas of concern** are introduced in the project for the convenience of planning, creating, coordinating, and changing models, and these relate to:

-   the three main roles -- areas of concern for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager. These are the columns of the 3x3 Table;
-   the three main systems -- areas of concern for the supersystem, the system of interest and the creator. These are the rows of the 3x3 Table.

In each area of concern, there will be its models, its areas of interest of roles and their preferences, as well as work artifacts. The 3x3 Table draws attention to specific areas of interest of the main roles at the level of specific subsystems. This is a kind of checklist. Accordingly, when implementing any project, you can list the documents (descriptions, models) that cover specific cells of the table.

**The three areas of interest of the main roles highlight the need for performers** of all the roles indicated in the 3x3 Table, who possess the corresponding methods (practices) and create the necessary work artifacts.

**The three areas of interest of the supersystem answer the corresponding questions**^[These questions were previously considered in the subsection "Systemness and Systematicness."] **when applying the system approach:**

1.  Area of interest of the supersystem: **why, for whom is it necessary to do something, and how will they change their behavior if offered something new?** Here, a hypothesis needs to be made about which communities of people can improve their lives by being offered a system through which they can play new roles and/or apply new methods (including technologies). For example, Henry Ford offered a car to all adults, and people became drivers to solve their space movement issues. Incidentally, not everything has to be new, for example, roles and discipline may not change, and you offer only new technology. For example, "SAP" for accountants who previously used Excel. The main objects of attention in this area of interest are: a group or community of people with their dissatisfactions, their roles and methods (including tools), and the role of the proposed system of interest.
2.  Area of interest of the system of interest: **what is this new thing in terms of the product (system), what are its characteristics and how is it structured, what is it made of?** After hypotheses are made about the area of interest of the supersystem and the role of the system of interest is defined, you can proceed to the system definition, including making architectural decisions. For example, watches for a space station, a person, and a tower will be entirely different not only in materials but also in the fundamental work scheme. Here, it will be necessary to calculate the total cost of ownership of the system and estimate its cost for the purchaser.
3.  Area of interest of creating systems: **who and how will create the system, including methods and resources?** After hypotheses are made about the structure of the system, we move to its direct creation. For this, it is necessary to define the methods (practices) with which it will be created. It is also necessary to allocate all the creator roles, select performer agents (people, contractor organizations, tools, and AI), and acquire other resources. Additionally, calculations must be made for the profitability of this entire undertaking.
