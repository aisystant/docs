title: Conclusion of the Section and Key Concepts
---

Areas of interest are several related characteristics or subjects of interest. These areas of interest are the focus of attention for all roles in the project, and since there are quite a few subjects of interest, for convenience in working with them, they can be grouped into specific areas. We identify areas of interest for the supersystem, the system of interest, and creating systems, as well as the subject areas of interest for the roles of entrepreneur, engineer, and manager.

Levels in the hierarchy of system decomposition are called systems levels. For each level, the systems actor sees their own roles, methods, systems, concepts, etc.

Chains of creation are creating systems that plan, create, and dispose of other creating systems.

I hope you have mastered the technique of distinguishing all the concepts covered in this section. However, it may not be immediately possible to apply these concepts to your project. For this, experience in realizing several projects is needed.

**Key concepts:** areas of interest, area of interest for the supersystem, system of interest, creator, subject areas of interest for the entrepreneur, engineer, and manager, model, activity roles; system decomposition, systems levels, meta-systems transition, emergence; chain of creation; discomforts, Systems Approach 3.0, scale-free, de-anthropomorphism, continuous development, multilevel evolution.
