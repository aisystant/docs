title: Value Chain Diagram
---

Sometimes, it is necessary to logically construct various interrelations to better understand how complex human activities are organized. The main goal is to find the place for your system and your team in the value chain.

**Various systems are interconnected through the operation stage into long value chains**. The picture shows the stages of three systems. The run-time stage is the operation stage.

These diagrams are convenient for telling stories such as:

- We are a startup that will grow into an IT company. The creation stages of an IT company are shown on the top line A.
- The company will produce an IT program for the digital twin of artificial structures, like bridges. The creation stages of the IT program are shown on line B.
- Our IT program will be part of the creating systems that design, build, and participate in the bridge's operation. The creation stages of the bridge are shown on line C.

It is **important for us to extend all reasoning to the system of interest -- the bridge.** And we will have to thoroughly work through this entire chain. It's not even fully documented here! There are more creating systems in this example.

If you do not learn to model and document such chains, each time bringing them to the system of interest, you risk aimlessly discussing what you are doing. However, by learning systems thinking, you will develop the skill of untangling any complex activity, attention separated into value chains, system levels, systems, stages, etc.

If you model and document the value chain, you can easily explain why your project is needed and how it will lead to the system of interest's success. The further you are along the value chain from the system of interest, the more attention you need to give to working with it. It is quite far from you, and your thinking will require effort to keep it in focus. Teams often "cannot see beyond their own noses" and do not want to deal with something so distant from their immediate activities. However, this mistake costs not only time and resources but also adds stress, as it hinders clarity and structure in project activities.

Using systems thinking, you find the system of interest^[First, you need to deal with the supersystem, the expected behavior of the system of interest, etc.], and then design (describe) the entire value chain up to "your" system^[If it is indeed somewhere in the value chain, and not within the system of interest (as a subsystem).], not skipping any system in this chain and keeping in mind the benefits of your project for the system of interest. This approach will bring clarity and organize your activities: personal life and work projects.
