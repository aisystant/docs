title: Creation Chain
---

Another important term associated with the three main types of systems is the **creation chain**. This term is more related to the creator or creating systems.

Let's continue examining the system of interest, the car. One of the creating systems for it will be the car factory. To build the factory, another creating system is needed, which will be the factory's creating system. This leads to long chains.

In the case of systems like a car or a bridge, such chains are often intuitively clear to many. But in the case of software, they can be much longer and more complex. This is because software needs to reach the physical world, meaning it should be connected to a system of interest. Software is rarely created just for the sake of it; it always leads to a system in the physical world.

Imagine, for example, any of the programming projects involved in creating a car. Why do they exist? Why all this software? So that ultimately a car is produced! Systems thinking requires tracing the entire chain from the IT program used in the creation project to the car itself.
