title: 'Execute modeling: 5.2. Type annotation using :: notation'
---

Refer to the example in the first line of the table. Use the most convenient type annotation option in the text --- double colon "::". First, the name of the object is written, then its type from the meta-model (or additionally from the meta-meta-model). For example: "airplane::system" or "table::system::physical object". If necessary, repeat the theoretical material on the :: notation in the "Rational Work" course.

For the sentences from the table, make a duplicate, indicating the types of all objects and relationships, as shown in the first line. Fill in the empty cells and write several examples from work and personal projects.
