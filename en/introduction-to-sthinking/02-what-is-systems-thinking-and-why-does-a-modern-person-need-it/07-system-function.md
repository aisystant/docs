title: System Function

The separation of the physical world and mental space helps to understand the difference between a **system** and its **function**. For example, a car is a physical object that exists in the real world. It is the embodiment of a system or a tangible object. A car, like any system, has a function, and in this case, that function is movement. Movement, like any system function, is abstract and cannot be touched. But we can see movement, or rather, we see the car that is moving.

**Function** (or behavior, or action) is assigned by people; objects do not choose functions for themselves. A hammer cannot assign itself the function of driving nails. An interested party can take a microscope and assign (name) it a "hammer," that is, allocate to it the function of driving nails. The hammer, in this case, will be nothing but a role for the microscope. Or a stone. Then the behavior (function) of the microscope in this role is driving nails.

People need not so much the object itself (material object) but its function. This is what makes it valuable to interested parties, although the layman rarely shares their views. A systems skill is a separate consideration and discussion of the **function** someone needs and the **construction (physical object)** that best suits performing this function.

The thought technique of separating a system from its function can also be applied to thinking itself. We can say that thinking is a function of intelligence. In this case, intelligence is the system, and thinking is its behavior or function.
