title: Systemness and Systematicness
---

Most people operate with a **“domestic” understanding of the concepts “system” and “systemic thinking.”** They imply by "systemness" personal organization, diligence, desire to anticipate everything, consider all possible details, and in general, everything that may be important. And this is incorrect!

**"Systemness" is often confused with "systematicness"** -- and systematically poor or incorrect thinking leads to disastrous results. Despite the fact that many dictionaries define systemness and systematicness as synonyms, we will differentiate these concepts. **Systematicness, regularity, discipline** mean that a person constantly, on a schedule, does something, whereas **systemness** means that a person can "cut" the world into different systems with their attention and work with these systems and various interests of people. And this is a separate thinking (systems) technique that requires systematic training.

Systemness defines "what to do," while systematicness means doing it regularly, constantly, rhythmically. One concept does not replace the other. **It is necessary to be both systemic and systematic.** Systemness is discussed in this course, and systematicness in the "Practices of Self-Development" course.

It is well known that everything in the world is interconnected, but systemness is not just about making sure no detail is missed. It is necessary to **highlight the important from the general background** and, conversely, fit something important into the overall context. Systemic thinking guides the attention of a specialist or team when implementing a project. Objects of attention are designated with certain concepts^[At the beginning of the previous subsection, such concepts as roles, methods, work artifacts, systems, architecture, etc., were provided. In this course, we will study several dozen concepts of systemic thinking.]. Using these concepts, we highlight with our attention both the important and the contexts. Therefore, our course:

- acquaints with several dozen such **systems concepts**;
- teaches **thinking techniques** and corresponding systems modeling that connect these concepts;
- develops the skill of **finding these concepts** in work and personal projects.

Let us introduce two systemic thinking techniques that will be revealed in the course.

The first technique draws attention to the fact that **any activity can be viewed through three interconnected areas**. They must answer the following questions:

1. Why, for whom, and for what purpose something needs to be done, and how will their behavior change if offered something new?
2. What is this new thing from the product (system) perspective, what are its characteristics, how is it structured, and from what is it created?
3. Who and how will create the system, including by what methods and with what resources?

The second technique concerns **the connection between analysis and synthesis or the allocation of functions and structures** **of the system.** In corporate culture, much is said about analysis. And rightly so. But one must not forget that analytical activity is only part; synthesis is also needed. Analysis is breaking down into parts, while synthesis is assembling and obtaining a work artifact (system). Systemic thinking uses both functional analysis, that is, dividing the system into functional parts, and modular synthesis, that is, assembling the whole system from structural parts. It is the work artifact or physical construction that becomes something new and changes behavior (changes the world), and it is for this that money is paid.

Considering the above, you need to prepare for the fact that many of your current ideas will conflict with the methodology of systemic thinking. And if you work with these inconsistencies through thought-writing (modeling), by the end of the course your worldview will be significantly updated.
