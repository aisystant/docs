title: Basic Concepts of Systems Thinking
---

People who change their country of residence and immerse themselves in another language are often asked: "What language do you think in now?" Thinking in a language means using it as a tool for organizing thoughts, planning, reasoning, and internal dialogue^[Language and thinking are closely related, but this does not mean that thinking completely depends on language.].

Language is a tool that can shape and structure thought processes. This concept is known as linguistic relativity or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity){target="_blank"}]. It suggests that the language we speak influences our perception of the world and our way of thinking.

Usually, when talking about "language," most people immediately think of foreign languages, and few think about professional languages. For example, the language of a physicist or mathematician, a swimmer or driver, an engineer or manager. This means that a person learns not just Russian or English but also professional languages throughout their life. In essence, learning professional languages is not much different from learning a conversational household language.

But apart from professional languages, there is also a meta-language or a systems language. The systems language uses its own words to designate specific concepts. Moreover, concepts can be named differently in various foreign languages. For example, the main concept of systems thinking can be expressed as "system" or "system." Besides the concept of system (which I am expressing now in Russian), there are other systems thinking concepts, such as the system of interest, supersystem, function, architecture, role, method (practice), and so on.

Therefore, one of the shortest answers to the question "What does systems thinking mean?" is "It's when you think in a systems language." After that, you can say that systems thinking helps create successful products and services that take numerous interests into account.

Learning systems thinking is necessary, like any foreign language. That is, you need to learn the concepts (words) and apply them in your projects and life. You literally need to immerse yourself in the environment, which is why it is so important to be in a community of like-minded people^[For example, this is why Aisystant develops as a community of like-minded people, and why we recommend writing your drafts in the Aisystant club.]. Of course, you first need to take this learning seriously and recognize the importance of mastering a systems language. After all, it will take years to gain fluency in it.

However, as with a foreign language, new opportunities arise later. These opportunities are more significant because **the systems language opens doors to any professional languages and to creating successful systems in work and personal life**. Moreover, you will be able to master these professions faster in any foreign language.

**Therefore, study systems methodology and think in a systems language, not just in colloquial Russian or English!**

One of the main skills of a modern person is **the ability to learn quickly**. Humans do this much faster than any animal on earth. But some people learn faster than others, making fewer mistakes and living better as a result. To learn quickly, you need to understand that learning is, first and foremost, the study of theories. And of course, theories need to be connected with practical activities. The best theories help humanity advance civilization.

Any theory, in turn, consists of specific concepts used to describe the world. These are the concepts you need to focus on when studying theories. Write them down and connect them while studying courses, and find their manifestations in the physical world.

In physics, concepts like physical body, speed, force, etc., are introduced. These concepts are needed to describe natural phenomena, the structure, and evolution of the material world. In accounting, concepts like asset, liability, double-entry bookkeeping, and others are introduced to describe the company's activities (balance sheet) for tax accounting. The course on systems thinking gathers concepts needed to create a successful system and organize a large team of specialists from different professions.

**Can you create systems without the concepts of systems thinking?** Of course, you can. But just as you can ignore the laws of physics or learn to swim directly in practice without understanding the theory of the crawl stroke. You'll achieve something regardless. We offer an intellectual language for explaining and changing the world, and in this, we compete with other schools of thought.

With the concepts of systems thinking, you can not only work faster, increasing the complexity of the systems you create but also apply these concepts to create entirely different systems: IT systems, airplanes or houses, nuclear plants, or a child ready for adult life.

Try to independently assess your level of proficiency in the concepts of systems thinking. Speak to yourself, or better yet, write down drafts for each item with the concepts of systems thinking. This contains most of the concepts studied in the AISYSTANT courses. They are grouped so that you don't just talk about each concept but also explain its difference from other similar concepts.

1. Systemness and Systematicness
2. Synergy and Emergence

This exercise is useful to perform during and after completing each AISYSTANT course. By studying each concept, you will be able not only to find common ground with entrepreneurs, engineers, and managers but also to learn new professional knowledge more quickly, becoming a sought-after specialist.
