title: Complexity
---

Systems thinking deals with complexity. **Complexity** is a concept with various meanings in different contexts and theories. We will discuss complexity in the following contexts:

- when encountering something **new and unknown**, it is inherently complex because we do not have pre-existing methods to handle it;
- when a **complex system** is created or present, for example, one consisting of a large number of elements with many connections, etc. This could be a system like "Enterprise of 1000 people" or a system "Electric vehicle";
- a system has a **large number of stakeholders**, whom it affects or who influence the system. Such a system is likely to be complex, but we distinguish this third type of complexity to highlight numerous interests in the system that need to be considered to create a successful system.

Systems thinking helps continuously increase the complexity you can manage throughout life. In addition to the ability to work with complexity, a systems practitioner increases the speed of work. But first, **it is necessary to gain fluency (speed) in applying systems thinking.** For this, you must gradually complicate the systems review of different types of systems:

1. start with the consideration of simple systems like "scissors," "chair," or "hammer";
2. then discuss your own body and personal mastery;
3. next, move on to IT systems (cyber-physical systems) where software is the personality, and "mastery" is one of the applications/application programs in this software^[If you are not an IT specialist, the analogy with personality will help you understand many aspects of IT. The human body can be viewed as IT hardware, and specific mastery (as part of personality) is the software.];
4. after that, move to teams and enterprises;
5. finally, access higher systemic levels -- community, society, humanity...

We do not recommend trying to apply systems thinking to your most complex project right away. This will only confuse you more and waste time. Try to take on the simplest project, and when you achieve fluency, move on to a more complex system.

In our course, we rely more on simple systems, and in the courses "Systems Thinking," "Methodology," and "Systems Engineering," you will consolidate this understanding and see similarities with other systems. By the end of the "Personality Engineering" course, you will be able to understand personality, and after successfully completing the "Systems Management" course, you can become a **development director** for an enterprise. Courses for higher systemic levels are under development.

Such a step-by-step approach trains the **ability** to **continuously** **increase** **the complexity and speed threshold.** Of course, everyone wants everything at once, but life rarely works that way. Systematicness must be trained together with systemness -- this will be your competitive advantage and ensure life is not dull. A systems thinker with **agency**^[Agency is the ability to set goals and act to improve one's current state. For this, the agent actively influences both themselves and the surrounding world. Agency can be compared to "a spur in the side."] will always have the motivated desire and ability to do something cool and needed by people, raising complexity to the level of humanity. This is the essence of endless development and personal self-improvement.
