title: Systems Approach 2.0
---

In the classical systems approach, systems were considered as material objects possessing three properties -- **integrity,** **emergence,** **and embedding**^[Don't confuse "embedding" with "hierarchical." The latter may appear in descriptions of first-generation system properties, but it's incorrect. Hierarchy is a more general principle than embedding. Embedding is a specific case of hierarchy, meaning not every hierarchy implies embedding. For example, a boss and subordinate -- that's hierarchy, but not embedding.]. But these systems were considered as ideal physical objects, unrelated to human interests. The connection with human interests appeared in the so-called systems approach 2.0, which is based on entirely different systems methodologies compared to the first generation^[In both the second and first generations of the systems approach, there are various systems methodologies. Each of them has its own set of concepts and thinking techniques. Their common distinguishing feature is that besides "system," each uses the concept of "role," or "stakeholder," or "interested parties." One such systems methodology of the second generation is the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ).].

The Systems Approach 2.0 does not reject the classical system properties introduced in the first generation. These are all necessary conditions for its existence but are no longer sufficient. In the modern interpretation, the concept of "system" acquires new additional properties arising from a **subjective view** of the system.

As we mentioned earlier, the classical approach is more abstract and considers ideal objects, whereas the **second-generation systems approach is pragmatic,** working with objects needed for someone or influencing certain people.

The Systems Approach 2.0 is not applied when there is no real project to discuss a table, a clock, a car. This is more like ideal objects of mental space, and often in conversation, no specific physical objects needed by particular people in specific projects are represented by them.

Systems thinking appears when we talk about systems like "office table," "wristwatch," "passenger car." In this case, at least, we can talk about **interests and concerned roles** wanting something from these systems. From this, the system is defined, its boundaries, and how it will be used.

In the Systems Approach 2.0, all project roles that somehow influence the system or people in certain roles it may affect are recognized as stakeholders. The combination of all project roles' interests determines what the system will be, its function, what it will consist of, etc.

The thinking technique involves the idea that "**No interests -- no system.**" For example, a car manufacturer creates a passenger car considering potential clients' possible interests in roles such as driver, passenger, user, owner, pedestrian, regulatory bodies, environmental advocates, etc. Whether it will be a passenger or a cargo vehicle, its type of engine or load capacity depends on stakeholder interests.

Every considered interest defines what the car should be. Without an ecological interest, there would be no need to install an exhaust gas purification subsystem meeting the Euro-6 standard. By installing such a subsystem in the car, the manufacturer has changed the system's arrangement.

Everything installed in a passenger car **is a response to some project role interest** that the car manufacturer decided to take into account. The "passenger car" system will be successful if the interests of all stakeholders (project roles) are considered (satisfied).

**Let us further discuss such a system thinking technique: first look** **"outside," then only** **"inside"** **the system.**

The system’s boundary (integrity), function, and structure depend on its interaction with project roles. Therefore, **the system discussion begins not with the internal design but with understanding** **its** **environment**. That is, which supersystem the system belongs to, who needs it, and what these stakeholders require, their problems, and interests in the system. Hence arises the important system principle: always start looking outside the system, only then inward.

For example, in the classical consideration of the "clock" system, a person would begin to examine its properties and look inward, that is, start discussing what it consists of. In modern consideration, it is necessary **to start by looking outside the system,** that is, investigating, of which supersystem the clock is a part, who needs them, and how they are used.

After such consideration, you understand whether the discussion is about wristwatches, cuckoo clocks, or tower clocks. Each of these clocks' structures will differ. Without listing and understanding the interests of the involved entities, it's impossible to talk about the system’s design.

Thus, in the Systems Approach 2.0, systems not only possess properties of integrity, emergence, and embedding but their important characteristic is that **systems depend on stakeholders** (project roles). The system's success relies on meeting stakeholders' interests; hence the review starts with the environment: first, we look outward, then inward the system.
