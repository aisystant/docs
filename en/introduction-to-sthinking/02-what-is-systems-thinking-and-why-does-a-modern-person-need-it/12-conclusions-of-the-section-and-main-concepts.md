Ordinary tasks are solved using applied skills, but when the complexity of problems and tasks goes off the charts, **intellect or thinking skills** are engaged.

Modern trends indicate that humans increasingly encounter **new problems and complex tasks**, and their resolution requires considering multiple different interests. Therefore, we can formulate the following wishes for the intellect that demonstrates systems thinking:

- Linking different worldviews;
- Universality in solving complex problems from different fields of activity;
- Constantly improving the speed and quality of solving new problems.

Humanity needs a high-level theory that can link different worldviews. For this, there is an **intelligence stack of 16 transdisciplines**, and the intellect loaded with this intelligence stack provides the function of systems thinking. Thanks to this, systems people manage to link different stakeholder interests in a non-contradictory manner.

**Key Concepts**: systems thinking, system, systems thinking 2.0; classical system properties: wholeness, emergence, embeddedness; model, theory, discipline, transdiscipline; intelligence stack, self-development practices, applied practices; systematization, systemness; applied skills, thinking skills, intellect, life skills.
