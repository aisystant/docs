title: 'On Communication: Form vs. Content'
---

Systems thinking is extremely useful for large teams, especially when it is necessary to organize the work of specialists from different professions. **Systems thinking is realized** **between people, and it is** **designed to** **help them agree** **with each other**^[This applies not only to the team but also to all interested parties.]. So let's pay attention to communication.

In any communication, there is a **transmission and reception of information.** In this exchange, we can distinguish the form of presentation and the content of what is conveyed. Everyone can notice for themselves what they react to more. To demonstrate the idea of "form vs. content," I will assume that an ordinary person pays 80% attention to form and only 20% to content^[These figures are conditional.].

A focused person can change this proportion by concentrating on the content. For example, by understanding from which role a person is speaking. **A focused person manages their attention**, meaning they consciously concentrate on the concepts and theories used by the interlocutor. An ordinary person is guided by intuition, meaning they primarily evaluate communication through the "fight-or-flight" reaction. They may be offended by the form without delving into the content, which could positively change their life.

If the brain is not trained to extract content, then the **natural mode** is activated --- paying more attention to the psycho-emotional aspect. The form is perceived faster and requires little effort. The form can indirectly judge the content. But it's essential to see the essence behind the form and understand the content, even despite the most unfavorable conditions for receiving it. This requires a separate skill that needs to be acquired. Ordinary people, if lucky, acquire it with age. But it's better to know about it and try to systematically develop it.

Students may complain about a teacher who conveys information in a dull and uninteresting way. We do not justify the teacher, but still, what should the student do? After all, they need the knowledge. They will have to improve their **role skill:** take control of the natural mode (when we pay attention to the form) and strive to delve into the content. Sometimes even push through the desperate desire to quit. It is better to be guided by the principle: "Nothing personal, just role interest."

You can train your role skill through practice, but at the same time, you need to understand the theory of roles, focus (managing attention), ontology and logic (realizing the subject area with its concepts and terms). Start using this **method of separating form and content** in communication.

Let's pay attention to several examples of the importance of content in the communication process:

1. In communication, it is necessary to adhere to the **principles** **of grounding.** Grounding means anchoring to the physical world. In the communication process, you convey some description of the world (systems), and therefore you need to ground your descriptions. This will increase the chances of being understood. It is important to tie abstract concepts and descriptions to specific situations in the physical world. If abstract concepts sound, you can ask for examples of situations to which these concepts apply. This will help avoid confusion and ensure clearer understanding. Examples of grounding can be seen in modeling tasks.
2. Each person looks at a system (has a specific interest) or models a specific situation based on their world model. Even if a person is not aware of it, they still rely on some theory (which they have studied) or on everyday understanding (folk wisdom, memes, experience, or upbringing). To agree with them, pay attention to their **ontology** (used concepts)^[For this, it is recommended to take the "Rational Work" course before the "Systems Thinking" course.], but at the same time, watch for creating an appropriate communication form. In addition, ontological thinking will help you not to confuse types marked by all words. For example, the type of words "Paris," "London," "Beijing" is a city, so the phrase "I visited Paris, London, and China" will sound odd. The fact is that it uses different types of words, namely -- type "city" and type "country." In systems thinking, it is also important not to confuse types, for example, "systems" and "processes," calling the cleaning process of a room a system, or stating that a "manager plays the role of an engineer"^[One can say that Ivan, being a manager, also sometimes plays the role of an engineer. In systems thinking, it is important not to confuse types; otherwise, it will be impossible to conduct modeling and communication in a large team.].
3. **Corporate culture** is based on values, mission, norms of behavior, traditions, and theories accepted in these organizations. But at the core of any culture is language, and this language reflects the practices and knowledge adopted by the entire team. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the concepts used by you personally and by your company's employees. To set up systems thinking, you first need to master the system language. Learn to speak it fluently, use it in communication, and incorporate it into your corporate culture.
4. When we talk about a **course**, we pay attention to the form of content presentation. This form can be discussed separately and in detail. For example, a course can be made in the form of a textbook or an online course in text or video format. Notice that we haven't said anything about the course content yet. It could be about management, marketing, or freestyle swimming. Keep in mind that the content of any course is a specific discipline (theory) or several interconnected disciplines. For example, in systems thinking courses^[In this context, when you hear the words "systems thinking," it is quite possible that someone wants to say they are taking a course by that name. Although, of course, it is most likely a discussion about thinking using the concept of "system" and other concepts from the intelligence stack transdisciplines.] the "systems thinking" discipline is not taught, but several intelligence stack transdisciplines are studied at once. The concepts and principles are chosen from all intelligence stack transdisciplines, allowing you to describe and develop techniques (approaches) for dividing the world into different systems and subsystems (highlighting systems and subsystems).
