title: 'Perform Modeling: 1.6. Classical Properties of a System'
---

Familiarize yourself with the examples in the first rows of the table. If necessary, review the theoretical material. Note that the column "System" provides examples of ideal objects. Recall the differences between the classical systems approach and systems approach 2.0, and in particular, what objective and subjective consideration of a system means.

Describe the properties of the systems listed in the table. You can additionally come up with your own examples. Highlight classical properties of systems from work and personal projects.

Form notes for subsequent elaboration as needed. For example, record reflections or questions in the "Notes" column, which can be asked later in support chats.

**Find the corresponding task by number in the modeling workspace and complete all its points.**
