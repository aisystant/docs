title: Why and What to Learn in the Modern World
---

Everyone learns throughout their life, but not everyone realizes it. Not everyone understands what they gain from learning, what they should personally learn, and what the role of a student is^[The answer to "How to learn?" is given in the course "Practices of Self-Development."]. Nevertheless, even unconscious knowledge and skills help a person understand the world: deal with uncertainties, solve problems, and achieve goals^[Including finding the meaning of life. Post "What is Important in Life" in the SC Club: [https://systemsworld.club/t/chto-v-zhizni-glavnoe/5034](https://systemsworld.club/t/chto-v-zhizni-glavnoe/5034){target="_blank"}.]. And the meaning of learning is one common answer to the question "why learn?"

**David Deutsch's Principle of Optimism**^[Post "About Optimism": [https://systemsworld.club/t/topic/3566](https://systemsworld.club/t/topic/3566){target="_blank"}.] states that there will always be problems, and only a lack of knowledge prevents a person from dealing with them at a moment in time. After all, if we know how to solve certain problems, then they are not problems for us. We just need to apply the knowledge we have—that is, to take action.

**Knowledge**^[Those that are relevant today, not outdated or unscientific.] is predominantly gained from **theories (disciplines)**^[Of course, practice is indispensable: "theory without practice is dead, practice without theory is blind."], and when we apply this knowledge in life (and use some tools for this), we demonstrate mastery. Through mastery, something changes (appears) in the physical world.

For example, a person studies the discipline of "Accounting," and then using the technology^[From now on, we will predominantly use the word "tool," while "technology" remains a synonym.] "1C" or SAP, they demonstrate accounting mastery by creating a **work artifact**^[A work artifact is a physical (you can touch it) result of your work. It can be presented in various ways, including writing texts, creating diagrams, developing databases, or physical objects (like a chair). Work artifacts help you study and apply practice with theory, as well as track progress and results of your work. In a specific course or practice, the list of work artifacts and their use is usually described in the relevant material or homework assignment.]—the balance sheet. In the same way, you can study "Carpentry," and then create a work artifact—a "chair"—using carpentry tools. The main thing is that certain physical objects have appeared in the world, and their appearance changes the world.

The first answer to "What to learn?" is: **learn the best theories, and master** **the tools** in these disciplines, to produce the best work artifacts. It's great if you manage to find your purpose, that is, to discover what you're naturally endowed with. And for this, you need to test your hypotheses, which means studying the relevant theory. For instance, if you have a talent for music, you can't do without music theory^[Of course, you can become a professional through practice, practice, and more practice, but without theory, it's a very long path (and without theory, the likelihood of success on it is much lower). Talent should ideally be supported by the best theories known to mankind, i.e., become cultured.], and if you get along well with people, systemic management will help you become a manager. **Without a good theory, fast and consistent progress is impossible**, achieving high and stable results.

To study any theory, it's important to understand that at the meta-level, it includes: **concepts** (terms), **principles** (theorems, laws, models), **roles, work artifacts, procedures** (checklists) for creating work artifacts, **explanations** (proofs, clarifications, justifications). For example, in the discipline of "Accounting," the concepts include—asset, liability, accountant, etc.; roles—accountant, tax inspector; principle—double-entry bookkeeping; work artifacts—balance sheet, profit and loss statement, etc.

The next answer to the question "What to learn?" is aided by dividing knowledge (theory, discipline) into the following two categories that develop:

1.  **thinking mastery**—it helps deal with new and unknown problems;
2.  **applied mastery**—solves a specific class of tasks^[For example, this includes the professional skills of a driver, swimmer, marketer, architect, or manager.].

For modern people, it is important to constantly develop thinking mastery (intelligence) and, when necessary, develop specific applied mastery (professional skills and abilities)^[How to increase your value in the labor market can be read in the SC Club post: [https://systemsworld.club/t/kak-povyshat-svoyu-czennost-na-rynke-truda-ili-pro-karla-rante-i-moniku-prodakt-menedzhera/4473](https://systemsworld.club/t/kak-povyshat-svoyu-czennost-na-rynke-truda-ili-pro-karla-rante-i-moniku-prodakt-menedzhera/4473){target="_blank"}.]. Thus, every person is simultaneously **an intellectual and a professional** in the sense that they must constantly deal with new problems using their intellect and solve a specific known class of tasks professionally^[A professional works almost automatically, that is, having unconscious competence. For example, you clean your apartment or drive a car automatically. But when you were just mastering a new skill, your intellect was predominantly engaged. Over time, the intellect is used less, and more actions are performed automatically. This is due to minimizing energy and attention costs, which are limited.] in a certain area.

Even when a child learns to walk, their intellect is engaged, and when they master this skill, they develop applied mastery^[That is, intellect also helps to quickly acquire new applied mastery. When a new problem arises, intellect switches on to find a solution based on existing experience and with the involvement of current applied mastery. Alternatively, intellect determines that new mastery is needed and helps to acquire it faster.]. In developing basic applied mastery, intellect is engaged, initially drawing on inherent reflexes and genes. And then it constantly develops as a person encounters something new. For example, a child goes to the store for the first time, leaves for another city to study after school, or solves new work problems. A person usually develops their intellect unconsciously.

We could use formal thinking techniques and approaches when we create a car or an IT program for the first time^[But nature didn't endow us with them.]. You can learn these techniques. Currently, the best thinking techniques are collected in **systems thinking**.

Applied disciplines (knowledge) work with specific physical systems, which can be identified at different levels or scales. For example, a therapist works with the entire organism, while a neurobiologist works at the cell level. Professionalism is the quick and quality resolution of an already known class of tasks. For instance, a professional swimmer can swim a certain distance, and a professional manager knows how to run an enterprise. To become a professional, you need to learn specific applied methods. A swimmer learns the crawl method, and a manager learns project management. It is for professionalism (rather than so much for intellect) that money is paid, professionals earn good money, and receive recognition. Intellect helps to become a professional faster. It is especially important when creating complex systems or if frequent retraining is necessary, or when working in large teams.

Since we learn throughout life, **conscious learning** is extremely important for us. This is why everyone needs to fundamentally understand the **importance of learning, the structure of any theory, the ability to choose the best knowledge and quickly learn it**.
