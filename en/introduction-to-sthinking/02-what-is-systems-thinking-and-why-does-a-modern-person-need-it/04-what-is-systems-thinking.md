title: What is Systems Thinking?
---

There is no exact **definition of the term "systems thinking"**, just as it is impossible to give a complete definition of the term "mother". We can say that systems thinking is a way of thinking that uses the concept of a system and other concepts from the [intelligence stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack){target="_blank"}. Or that to think systematically is to think in the language of systems^[Post "In what language do you think?" on the Systems Thinking Club: [https://systemsworld.club/t/na-kakom-yazyke-ty-dumaesh/7878](https://systemsworld.club/t/na-kakom-yazyke-ty-dumaesh/7878){target="_blank"}]. Or that systems thinking creates successful products and services by considering numerous interests^[Throughout the course, you will receive dozens of explanations of what systems thinking is. You will even come up with your own explanations and analogies.].

There is nothing supernatural, mystical, or esoteric in systems thinking. We will not delve into the structure of thinking at the neuro-level or discuss various psychological aspects. We believe that any type of thinking is developed through the study of specific theories (disciplines and transdisciplines) that are applied in real life. These concepts are what you will study and apply in your work and personal projects.

**Why is systems thinking necessary?**

Our world is complex and changes rapidly. But what makes it complex and what exactly changes quickly?

The complexity lies in the existence of **many interests of different people**. And it is not only these interests that change quickly but also knowledge and work methods, workplaces, teams, and fields of activity. To create successful products and services, it is necessary to **be able to work with modern speeds and complexity**. Systems thinking solves this problem.

For example, when creating a car, it is necessary to consider the interests of the driver, passenger, pedestrian^[To avoid causing significant harm in a collision.], car owner^[To ensure it does not break down and does not depreciate significantly.] and car manufacturer^[To ensure the car sells well.], aesthete^[The car should be beautiful.], environmentalist^[To ensure the car does not pollute the environment.] and interests of several hundred other roles. Every interest is backed by a specific worldview (model, description). Similar interests can be identified in your systems. For example, a renovated apartment, a well-raised and adult-ready child, a planted tree, an IT application, an enterprise, etc.

Moreover, in the modern world, it is necessary to **quickly adapt to new conditions and** **learn new things as quickly as possible**. Nowadays, every person has to constantly master new practices or professions and understand new spheres of activity without stress and delays.

The mastery of systems thinking will help you **understand a new area of activity** within 2 weeks. A person without systems thinking may study this activity for several years. Why does this happen? Because a person with systems thinking will pay attention to the system of interest and other systems (supersystem, creating systems, etc.), roles, methods, work artifacts, functional and modular parts, system architecture, enterprise architecture, and other focus objects present in any sphere of activity. You can find all these concepts in IT, cooking, or infrastructure projects (road sphere).

Humanity is moving towards **the division of labor**. For instance, several centuries ago, there was one role—"medicus"—who dealt with all human diseases. Now, medicine includes several hundred (if not thousands) of roles. This division of labor occurs in all fields of human activity. However, no individual can deeply master all roles. But to understand which specialists you need (and which roles they should play in your projects), systems thinking is necessary. It allows you to "slice" the world into separate, but interconnected systems and subsystems.

Developed systems thinking not only helps you quickly integrate into a new world or new projects but also **manage attention**, discarding what is unimportant at a given moment while maintaining a holistic vision. Our brain might lack the computational power to process all project details, so it is necessary to concentrate all its resources in the right "place" and change this "place" as necessary. You also need to understand the principles of the arrangement and connection of all "places" with each other. Knowing the principles of systems thinking, the time for a work meeting can be reduced from an hour to 10 minutes^[We discuss only what matters, skillfully manage attention and distinguish focus objects for the entire team.].

It should be noted that while systems thinking allows for quickly resolving problems in various work areas, it **does not replace practical mastery**. However, with systems thinking, you will progress faster in your practical area of activity and become a professional more quickly.

Systems thinking allows us to break down complex projects into simpler parts, **connect theory and practice**, work in large teams, and organize your team. It also helps us keep all project aspects in mind and in special modeling tools^[Our course as a simulator also teaches you modeling.]
so important aspects of the project are not forgotten amidst the chaos.

Systems thinking is universal and scalable, allowing application to objects of various complexities: whether inert substances, living beings, cyber-physical systems, personalities, organizations, communities, or even humanity as a whole.

We believe that systems thinking is necessary for any modern individual who wishes to make a career and **become a development director** of a large business. But systems thinking is universal, thus suitable for the development of oneself, one's child, community, and society.

**What do the words "systems thinking" mean?**

In the previous section, we already discussed that most people operate with a **household understanding of systems thinking**, confusing the concepts of "systemness" and "systematicity".

Sometimes "systems thinking" refers to a certain exceptional human ability. For example, the ability to combine analysis (understood as the ability to dive deeply into details) and synthesis (understood as the ability to emerge timely from those details). This is what is called the ability to see the whole picture. It's good to have such an ability, just as it's good to be rich and healthy, rather than sick and poor.

Unfortunately, such explanations are not about the "system" and a systems approach. Discussing the need to dive into and emerge from details does not offer a chance to understand how to master this technique, and how to apply it in the daily activities of a businessperson, engineer, manager, or other specialist.

Systems thinking implies human thinking that operates with a specific systems language. **Systems thinking is thinking using the concept of "system" and other concepts set in **specific transdisciplines** [intelligence stack](https://system-school.ru/stack#istack){target="_blank"}. **This includes concept formulation, ontology, physics, mathematics, and more.** One can also add that it is the application of thinking techniques of the systems approach.

There are numerous variants of **systems approaches**^[You will learn more about this in the "Systems Thinking" course.]. Generally, an approach means concepts, thinking methods, and action techniques developed within one discipline (subject area) are subsequently applied to other disciplines and subject areas. Our variant of systems approach is the application of concepts, techniques, and methods of transdisciplines within the intelligence stack to work and personal areas^[And accordingly to the disciplines needed for implementing numerous work and personal projects. We speak of the third generation of the systems approach.].

The systems approach belongs to methodologies. The main thing about them is the approach, as the transfer of knowledge. Systems thinking is a human ability (and the key here is the word "thinking").

**Human thinking is a mental (intellectual) activity**, resulting in forming a description of reality. This helps in further necessary actions, including creating products (systems) and services. To form such a description, we use words (terms, concepts). And if you have not specifically studied systems thinking, you are likely to use everyday words, not the concepts of the modern intelligence stack.

The difference between a layperson and a systems professional is that the latter operates with systems concepts such as system, role, method (practice), work artifact, architecture, alpha, function, functional and physical objects, emergence, and others studied in our course.

Systems thinking requires special learning, just like mathematics, physics, marketing, or management. The first thing to do in this learning (as in any other) is to pay attention to the conceptual minimum and apply it in practice^[Systems thinking does not emerge from practice alone without studying transdisciplines, or it takes decades.].

Our course also trains thinking techniques. **Thinking techniques** are the ability to connect different concepts with each other and find physical objects in real projects linked to these concepts. For example, to find the *system of interest* and *creator*, identify the connection "role-method (practice)-work artifact", and divide the system into *functional* and *modular* parts. This is why we recommend studying this course with mandatory modeling. By applying systems thinking concepts and techniques to a work project, **the team saves time and resources in creating a successful system** and reaches agreements more quickly.

In the process, you will have to **learn to think about three interconnected systems at once**: the "*system of interest*", "*supersystem*", and "*creating systems*". You will have to master systems thinking on several logical levels. You will need to find these systems in your activity, clients, and suppliers. You will need to think about numerous stakeholders in these systems and work with them, distinguishing their interests, roles, and titles, and based on this, prepare different descriptions (models) of these systems. All while not confusing *titles* with *roles*.

It is important to emphasize that **systems thinking is a specific behavior of the intellect**. The intellect is responsible for solving new problems, meaning those you have not encountered before. And for this, concepts and techniques of systems thinking are needed.

A person **thinks using mastered concepts and techniques**, describing the world, work project, and created systems with their help. Thus, it can be said that systems thinking reproduces the knowledge of the "Systems Thinking" course just as mathematical thinking reproduces the knowledge of a mathematics course. A person with systems thinking literally speaks in systems language, forms system definitions, and creates successful systems. In systems thinking, the concept of a "successful system" means that the interests of all identified project roles related to this system were considered in its creation.

Systems thinking brings **universality**, **speed**, and **quality** in solving new complex tasks when working with various stakeholders. Systems thinking manifests in the speed of creating successful systems. For this, it is necessary to be able to work with different interests, which are considered (satisfied) by creating a system definition. Consideration of various interests allows solving the most complex tasks faced by humanity or an individual in various fields of activity.
